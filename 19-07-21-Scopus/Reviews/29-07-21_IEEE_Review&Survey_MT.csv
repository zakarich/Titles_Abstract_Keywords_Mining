The need of the hour is to bridge this gap. The various factors responsible for this divide as studied in the literature review of Digital Divide are: the language barrier, cost factor, technology awareness, lack of resources etc. To study the factors responsible for the digital divide in Jammu region, a pilot survey was conducted which revealed many factors to be same as those found in the literature survey, language being one of the major factors responsible for this divide. Many initiatives have been taken by the government to bridge this divide i.e. costs of computing have been cut down, computer facilities have been provided and a lot of work has been done even in the language field. In today's time, the web supports multilingualism. English is not the only language supported by computers today. In the state of Jammu and Kashmir, languages are majorly spoken arey: Urdu, Kashmiri, Hindi and Dogri. Machine Translation systems for translating Hindi and English text to Urdu are available, Kashmir University is working on the development of translation tools for Dogri, but no work of translation is done for the Dogri language.

It is a topic of active research now a days as the results found so far from machine translation tools are very unrealistic as compared to the human translation. Many different new approaches and techniques have evolved along with the new advent in machine translation. There are different paradigm of machine translation including Statistics Based Machine Translation (SBMT), Rule Based Machine Translation(RBMT), Hybrid machine translation(HMT). Besides these, Neural Network Based Systems have been developed for machine translation [1]. We have not yet imparted the human kind of translation capabilities to the machine. Various online MT tools when tested on various input paragraphs from literature, though performed remarkably good but could hardly translate the sentences comparable to us, the humans. This paper provides a comparative study based on the translation of paragraphs by various online machine translation tools. The tools tested for this research involves rule based systems(Angla Bharti and Anubaad), and statistical systems (Bing, Google translator, IM translate that is supported by Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, Babylon Translator and other MT engines).

Trends and challenges in language modeling for speech recognition and machine translation,H. Schwenk,"University of Le Mans, France",2009 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding,08-Jan-10,2009,,,23,23,"Summary form only given. Language models play an important role in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems and statistical approaches to machine translation (SMT), in particular when modeling morphologically rich languages. Despite intensive research over more than 20 years, state-of-the-art LVCSR and SMT systems seem to use only one dominant approach: n-gram back-off language models. This talk first reviews the most important approaches to language modeling. I then discuss some of the recent trends and challenges for the future. An interesting alternative to the back-off n-gram approach are the so-called continuous space methods. The basic idea is to perform the probability estimation in a continuous space. By these means better probability estimations of unseen word sequences can be expected. There is also a relative large body of works on adaptive language models. The adaptation can aim to tailor a language model to a particular task or domain, or it can be performed over time. Another very active research area are discriminative language models. Finally, I will review the challenges and benefits of language models trained an very large amounts of training material.",,978-1-4244-5478-5,10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373531,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373531,,Natural languages;Speech recognition;Surface-mount technology;Vocabulary,estimation theory;language translation;speech recognition,large vocabulary continuous speech recognition;machine translation statistical approach;morphologically rich languages;continuous space methods;discriminative language models;adaptive language models;n-gram back-off language models;probability estimation;word sequences,,,,,,08-Jan-10,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this context, it is possible to reduce translation costs by using machine translation systems with post-editing. Modern machine translation systems have come a long way from bilingual dictionaries to multi-lingual localization platforms and continue to develop rapidly. By the use of neural networks deep learning, translation quality has almost reached the level of manual translation. However, machine translation has disadvantages and limitations, understanding of which allows using such systems to reduce time and costs for scientific texts translation. The paper formulates and systematizes main features of machine translation application, as well as gives recommendations for preparing a source text for translation, which are relevant not only when using machine translation systems, but also for human translation, especially for texts of specific subjects. By the example of a scientific and technical text and performing an experiment it is demonstrated how the quality of machine translation changes when described recommendations are applied.

Informative Document on queen Elizabeth is been writing by foreign language English which makes its difficult for a Marathi reader to understand and seek History of England, on Similar lines Literature Work on Shivaji is mostly documented in Marathi which makes foreign Historians difficult to gain know, in both case user is at times unknown of facts due to language and may lose interest on information. Vital information on current happing on village and taluka level are been published in newspaper with local language which setback information spread among other Masses. Many Time government documents and forms are been presented in English Language where a lay man from Marathi language background finds difficulty to understand information and even avoid such procedures therefore it highly urges for need of automated Software based Translation system which would assist in cross Domain information Retrieval. Machine Translation assist to translate Information presented in one language to other language. Information can be present in form of text, speech and image translating this information helps for sharing of information and ultimately information gain. A lot of work has been done on Translation of English to Hindi, Tamil Bangla and other foreign languages also. Machine Translation is challenging Research Area with numerous issues due to language ambiguity like grammar, Structure and even fluency of use. Numerous Methodologies have been proposed and developed which have uplifts and downfalls also, Although statistical and rule based at core with each having limitations, rule based produce accurate mapped translation and are trainable system but costly, whereas statistical produce fluent translation but lack accuracy and sense. Hybrid is combine approach which integrated approach and helps to optimize translation output. The research manuscript we present hybrid machine Translator for English to Marathi language which translated Web pages, text Documents on Agriculture (crops fruits for farmer), Medical reports in Marathi and tourism related information. Proposed System consists of Parallel Multi-Engines which process statistical and rule based Translation for same input document and produce a optimized result by performing statistical over rule based which give fluent language sense outputs. Mapper algorithm is been used in rule based Translation, with Agriculture corpus, medical and tourism corpus for statistical evaluation. Marathi wordnet has been implemented to enhance dictionary and incorporate better translation result Currently System has been proposed for text Document which can be extended to speech and voice. Comparative analysis for point view in one dimension of only limited set of Queries is done with Google Translator. Holding hybrid approach as better methodology.

Toward machine translation with statistics and syntax and semantics,D. Wu,"Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, Human Language Technology Center, HKUST, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Hong Kong",2009 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding,08-Jan-10,2009,,,12,21,"In this paper, we survey some central issues in the historical, current, and future landscape of statistical machine translation (SMT) research, taking as a starting point an extended three-dimensional MT model space. We posit a socio-geographical conceptual disparity hypothesis, that aims to explain why language pairs like Chinese-English have presented MT with so much more difficulty than others. The evolution from simple token-based to segment-based to tree-based syntactic SMT is sketched. For tree-based SMT, we consider language bias rationales for selecting the degree of compositional power within the hierarchy of expressiveness for transduction grammars (or synchronous grammars). This leads us to inversion transductions and the ITG model prevalent in current state-of-the-art SMT, along with the underlying ITG hypothesis, which posits a language universal. Against this backdrop, we enumerate a set of key open questions for syntactic SMT. We then consider the more recent area of semantic SMT. We list principles for successful application of sense disambiguation models to semantic SMT, and describe early directions in the use of semantic role labeling for semantic SMT.",,978-1-4244-5478-5,10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373509,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373509,,Statistics;Surface-mount technology;Space technology;Machine learning;Humans;Computer science;Labeling;Hardware;Speech recognition;Pattern recognition,computational linguistics;language translation;programming language semantics;statistics,toward machine translation;statistics;syntax;semantics;statistical machine translation;three dimensional MT model space;socio geographical conceptual;token based evolution;tree based syntactic SMT;hierarchy transduction grammars;inversion transductions;set key open;sense disambiguation models;SMT semantic,,3,,54,,08-Jan-10,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
