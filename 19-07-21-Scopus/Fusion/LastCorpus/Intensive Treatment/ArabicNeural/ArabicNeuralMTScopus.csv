In earlier work, we devised a data selection method based on semi-supervised convolutional neural networks (SSCNNs). The new method, Bi-SSCNN, is based on bitokens, which use bilingual information. When the new methods are tested on two translation tasks (Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English), they significantly outperform the other three data selection methods in the experiments. We also show that the Bi-SSCNN method is much more effective than other methods in preventing noisy sentence pairs from being chosen for training. More interestingly, this method only needs a tiny amount of in-domain data to train the selection model, which makes fine-grained topic-dependent translation adaptation possible. In the follow-up experiments, we find that neural machine translation (NMT) is more sensitive to noisy data than statistical machine translation (SMT). Therefore, Bi-SSCNN which can effectively screen out noisy sentence pairs, can benefit NMT much more than SMT.We observed a BLEU improvement over 3 points on an English-to-French WMT task when Bi-SSCNNs were used. © 2016 The Authors."

Therefore, a lot of research has been spent in improving its accuracy. Off-the-shelf tools, however, are: i) complicated to use and ii) domain/dialect dependent. We explore three language-independent alternatives to morphological segmentation using: i) data-driven sub-word units, ii) characters as a unit of learning, and iii) word embeddings learned using a character CNN (Convolution Neural Network). On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics."

The three MT systems used in this study were Systran's Pure Neural Machine Translation (PNMT), Google Translate (GT) and Microsoft Bing (MB). The target gender-bound constructs were subject-verb agreement, adjectival-noun agreement and pronoun-Antecedent agreement, which occurred naturally in four purposefully selected technical texts. The idea behind the choice of technical texts was to reduce the linguistic load found in other genres, such as literary texts, which involve utilising creative linguistic tools that are out of the scope of the present paper. Upon the qualitative examination of the target language texts, the findings revealed that the three MT systems had errors and non-errors in rendering gender-bound constructs from English to Arabic, and that errors transpired in certain co-Textual environments."

In this paper, we use Uyghur as the receipt language and try to detect loanwords in four donor languages: Arabic, Chinese, Persian and Russian. We conduct two groups of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach: loanword identification and OOV translation in four language pairs and eight translation directions (Uyghur-Arabic, Arabic-Uyghur, Uyghur-Chinese, Chinese-Uyghur, Uyghur-Persian, Persian-Uyghur, Uyghur-Russian, and Russian-Uyghur). Experimental results on loanword identification show that our method outperforms other baseline models significantly.

A well-established machine translation approach for automatically extracting paraphrases, leverages bilingual corpora to find the equivalent meaning of phrases in a single language, is performed by »pivoting» over a shared translation in another language. Neural machine translation has recently become a viable alternative approach to the more widely-used statistical machine translation. In this paper, we revisit bilingual pivoting in the context of neural machine translation and present a paraphrasing model based mainly on neural networks. Our model describes paraphrases in a continuous space and generates candidate paraphrases for an Arabic source input. Experimental results across datasets confirm that neural paraphrases significantly outperform those obtained with statistical machine translation, in particular the Google translator, and indicate high similarity correlation between our model and human translation, making our model attractive for real-world deployment. © 2018 The Authors.

This, however, limits the accuracy and the generalization capability of the models, especially for morphologically-rich languages, which usually have very sparse vocabularies containing rare inflected or derivated word forms. Some studies tried to overcome this problem by segmenting words into subword level representations and modeling translation at this level. However, recent findings have shown that if these methods interrupt the word structure during segmentation, they might cause semantic or syntactic losses and lead to generating inaccurate translations. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we present an extensive evaluation of two unsupervised vocabulary reduction methods in NMT. The first is the well-known byte-pair-encoding (BPE), a statistical subword segmentation method, whereas the second is linguistically-motivated vocabulary reduction (LMVR), a segmentation method which also considers morphological properties of subwords. We compare both approaches on ten translation directions involving English and five other languages (Arabic, Czech, German, Italian and Turkish), each representing a distinct language family and morphological typology. LMVR obtains significantly better performance in most languages, showing gains proportional to the sparseness of the vocabulary and the morphological complexity of the tested language.

The main part of NMT is a recurrent neural network, which can work with sequential data at word and sentence levels, given that sequences are not too long. Due to the large number of word and sequence combinations, a parallel dataset is required, which unfortunately is not always available, particularly for low resource languages. Therefore, we adapted a character neural translation model that was based on a combined structure of recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network.

Most previous works on automatic Arabic diacritic recovery rely on a large number of manually engineered features, particularly for case-endings. In this work, we present a unified character level sequence-to-sequence deep learning model that recovers both types of diacritics without the use of explicit feature engineering. Specifically, we employ a standard neural machine translation setup on overlapping windows of words (broken down into characters), and then we use voting to select the most likely diacritized form of a word.

In this paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a subset of words for diacritic restoration, which leads to selective homograph disambiguation. Compared to full or no diacritic restoration, these approaches yield selectively-diacritized datasets that balance sparsity and lexical disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection strategies extrinsically on several downstream applications: neural machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic textual similarity.

Unknown word (UNK) symbols are used to represent out-of-vocabulary words because NMT typically operates with a fixed vocabulary size. These rare words can be effectively encoded as sequences of subword units by using algorithms, such as byte pair encoding (BPE), to tackle the UNK problem. However, for languages with highly inflected and morphological variations, such as Arabic, the aforementioned method has its own limitations that make it not effective enough for translation quality. To alleviate the UNK problem and address the inconvenient behavior of BPE when translating the Arabic language, we propose to utilize a romanization system that converts Arabic scripts to subword units. We investigate the effect of our approach on NMT performance under various segmentation scenarios and compare the results with systems trained on original Arabic form. In addition, we integrate Romanized Arabic as an input factor for Arabic-sourced NMT compared with well-known factors, namely, lemma, part-of-speech tags, and morph features. Extensive experiments on Arabic-Chinese translation demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively tackle the UNK problem and significantly improve the translation quality for Arabic-sourced translation.

Despite the advances achieved in this field, several challenges remain to be resolved for machine translation (MT) to be on par with professional human translation, including the quality of grammar and context accuracy, pragmatics, relevance, choice of vocabulary and ability to translate large files effectively based on this list's criteria. Another extremely problematic area that we have observed is incorrect literal translation of English phrases, proverbs, idioms, figurative speech and clichés, which proves to be an issue with most current translation programs, even ones built using a phrase-based approach. Therefore, this study's objective was to develop a prototype of an English-Arabic MT engine, AccurIT, to address MTs' English-to-Arabic translation-accuracy issues in general. We compared the results of our tool against Google and Azure Translation Hub based on some excerpts from the legal realm to demonstrate AccurIT's efficacy, and the results are promising. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

However, most of the language pairs, such as Korean-Arabic and Korean-Vietnamese, do not have enough resources to train machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose the use of synthetic methods for extending a low-resource corpus and apply it to a multi-source neural machine translation model. We showed the improvement of machine translation performance through corpus extension using the synthetic method. We specifically focused on how to create source sentences that can make better target sentences, including the use of synthetic methods. We found that the corpus extension could also improve the performance of multi-source neural machine translation. We showed the corpus extension and multi-source model to be efficient methods for a low-resource language pair.

This can be accomplished by employing techniques like Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) or Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

This data article presents a monolingual parallel corpus of Arabic text called A7?ta ([Figure presented]). It contains 470 erroneous sentences and their 470 error-free counterparts. This is an Arabic parallel corpus that can be used as a linguistic resource for Arabic natural language processing (NLP) mainly to train sequence-to-sequence models for grammar checking. Sentences were manually collected from a book that has been prepared as a guide for correctly writing and using Arabic grammar and other linguistic features. Although there are a number of available Arabic corpora of errors and corrections [2] such as QALB [10] and Arabic Learner Corpus [11], the data we present in this article is an effort to increase the number of freely available Arabic corpora of errors and corrections by providing a detailed error specification and leveraging the work of language experts. © 2018 The Authors"	Arabic language; Error checking; NLP; Parallel corpus	Data Paper	Final	"All Open Access, Gold, Green"	Scopus	2-s2.0-85058692689

One of the main reasons for this imperfection is the decoding task complexity. Indeed, the problem of finding the one best translation from the space of all possible translations was and still is a challenging problem. One of the most successful ways to address it is via n-best list re-ranking which attempts to reorder the n-best decoder translations according to some defined features. In this paper, we propose a set of new re-ranking features that can be extracted directly from the parallel corpus without needing any external tools. The feature set that we propose takes into account lexical, syntactic, and even semantic aspects of the n-best list translations. We also present a method for feature weights optimization that uses a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm.

As mentioned in the literature, Urdu is considered as low-resource language. An impressive effort has been made for Arabic, French and Chinese language transliteration as compared to the Urdu language. Machine translation of Urdu language is a challenging problem. A very minute research work has been conducted toward Urdu transliteration. Factors behind the ignorance of Urdu language in research may be for its morphological complexity, diversity and most importantly due to the lack of reasonable bilingual parallel dataset. Getting a corpus for a language transliteration is the main resource to work on. This paper demonstrates the application of neural machine translation (NMT) for Urdu language transliteration, with the emphasis on contextual coverage of a language, which helps to improve transliteration accuracy. Build a robust NMT model which delivers efficient performance when trained over bilingual parallel corpora. Neural machine translation is an emerging technique depicting impressive performance, better than traditional MT methods in multiple aspects. In this research, we build the NMT model for the Urdu language to improve transliteration quality. An attention-based encoderdecoder system is proposed, and our experiment proves the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Governments have been striving to prevent the spread of the virus through the lockdown. During the strict lockdown in Jordan, people needed to stay home, and they used available social networks to keep updated on COVID-19, with Facebook, the most popular social media platform. The study aimed to elicit information about assessing the use of FTS as a source of information in general and on COVID-19, in particular, FTS for those interested in English posts. However, it cannot read them and how reliable users think FTS is. The questionnaire was sent through the available networking sites, such as Facebook Messenger. The study found that 94.3% use Facebook daily; 87.1% of the participants activated Facebook Translation Service (FTS). It is found that 62.2% of the participants considered Facebook as a primary source of information regarding COVID-19 and 27.8% as secondary source. In terms of FTS usage, 87.3% used FTS in translating English Facebook posts into Arabic, and 83.8% used FTS in translating English Facebook COVID-19 posts into Arabic during the lockdown. On the other hand, it is found that the majority found FTS committed minor errors in terms of adequacy and fluency. This success is due to the usage of Neural Machine Translation (NMT)approach and bilingual text corpora. The advantage is that FTS is a well-trained database that can provide more accurate translation than other model. In conclusion, disregarding FTS output quality, our research shows that Facebook and FTS became a significant source of information during abrupt crises. Such research would encourage government officials to better use Facebook and FTS as complements to their national health campaigns. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved."

Due to these differences, there is a need to translate these dialects between each other to facilitate their understanding and handling by people who will use them from other communities. The tremendous technological advancement and the flourishing of the era of Deep Learning, has led to the emergence of so-called neural machine translation (NMT), which has significantly facilitated the translation process compared to other methods.

Two systems are proposed for this problem. The first one is the Dialectal to Standard Language Translation (D2SLT) system, which is based on the standard attentional sequence-to-sequence model while introducing two novel ideas leveraging similarities among dialects: using common words as anchor points when learning word embeddings and a decoder scoring mechanism that depends on cosine similarity and language models. The second system is based on the celebrated Google NMT (GNMT) system. We first evaluate these systems in a supervised setting (where the training and testing are done using our parallel corpus of Jordanian dialect and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)) before going into the unsupervised setting (where we train each system once on a Saudi-MSA parallel corpus and once on an Egyptian-MSA parallel corpus and test them on the Jordanian-MSA parallel corpus). The highest BLEU score obtained in the unsupervised setting is 32.14 (by D2SLT trained on Saudi-MSA data), which is remarkably high compared with the highest BLEU score obtained in the supervised setting, which is 48.25. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"	Neural machine translation; Regression-based decoding; Shared embedding; Unsupervised dialectal translation	Article	Final		Scopus	2-s2.0-85077235214

As the main branch of artificial intelligence, machine translation based on neural network has significantly exceeded the traditional statistical machine translation in small language translation. Resource-poor language has become a hot topic, such as Uygur translation, as a typical resource-poor language, although there are some achievements in Uygur information processing, its basic available tools are very limited. This paper first expounds the background of the topic, briefly introduces the background knowledge of machine translation and the language knowledge of related languages. This paper describes the machine translation method based on neural network, and analyzes the existing neural machine translation methods on Uygur-Chinese translation tasks. The analysis of Uygur, Turkish, Arabic and Japanese finally determines the transfer translation of Uygur in Japanese. The parallel corpus of Uygur-Chinese and Japanese-Chinese are used to experiment. © 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series."

CAs offer instant responses and can concurrently assist a potentially unlimited number of users. The modeling of CAs in Arabic has so far received less attention when compared with other languages due to the complexity of the Arabic language, the existence of several dialects, and a lack of data resources. The literature contends that modeling a CA in Arabic mostly done using pattern-matching and information retrieval, employing classification approaches with a closed-domain data source. There is extremely limited research so far on modeling an open-domain CA in the Arabic dialect. This research has utilized a deep-learning architecture, known as the Seq2Seq neural network, to build a CA in the Arabic Gulf dialect. We formulated the CA problem as a machine translation problem and, therefore, built our corpus from tweets, in the post-reply format, to train and evaluate the model. We investigated the effects of pretrained embeddings on the performance of the CA. For our evaluation, a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score and human evaluators were used. The performance of the model was found to be comparable with existing deep learning models that have been trained on much larger corpora and in other languages. Our results present a promising first step towards building an open-domain CA in the Gulf Arabic dialect. © 2020 IEEE."

Machine Translation MT technology, considered as a subfield, has received important development with different approaches and techniques. Although, many MT systems and tools that support Arabic already exist; however, the quality of the translation is moderate and needs some improvement. In addition, the high demand for effective technologies to process and translate information from/to Arabic motivated the researchers in Arabic Machine Translation (AMT) to propose new approaches and solutions following the mainstream method, notably neural machine translation (NMT). In this paper, we provide a broad review and compare different NMT approaches for Arabic-English (and English-Arabic) machine translation research works. The discussed approaches address different linguistic and technical challenges and problems while demonstrating great success compared to traditional methods. The results of this work can serve the researchers and professional to be up-to-date and provide them with the necessary resources for modelling and improving of the AMT. These resources include corpora, toolkits, techniques and new models. The obtained results outline various findings, critics, and open issues in this area.

It is difficult to find the essential reason of these problems because they are only shown in the prediction results and all aspects of the model training. Different from the usual solutions based on complex mathematical rule setting and adding artificial features, we expect to turn the problems in the predictions into noise as much as possible. On this basis, we further use adversarial training to make the model find the balance between the noise and the golden samples, instead of exploring the reason of the problem during the complex training. In this paper, a noise-based preprocessing operation and a slight modification of the adversarial training can help the model to better generalize a series of referential problems in low-resource NMT tasks. Experiments show that the evaluation of BLEU score and the accuracy of pronouns in sequence on Korean-Chinese, Mongolian-Chinese and Arabic-Chinese task have been significantly improved. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Automatic machine translation uses a computer to translate text or speech from one language to another. Arabic Language is one of the seven united nations officially spoken languages. Few efforts tried to translate officially Arabic language to other languages. The inaccurate Translation of Arabic language might lead to several problem especially when we translate the holy text of Quran into other language. The aim of this paper is to use neural machine translation to enhance the translation quality of Arabic to Italian. The main contribution of this paper is to propose two deep learning models, namely LSTM and GRU, with attention mechanism to translate the Arabic Holy Quran to Italian. The proposed models are evaluated based on the BLEU and ROUGE score. The experimental results indicate that the BLEU and ROUGE score of LSTM have achieved Average score 0.18 and 0.17 on BLEU and ROUGE score respectively. also, the result of GRU have achieved Average score 0.17 and 0.16 on BLEU score and ROUGE score respectively. © 2021 IEEE."

Prior to NMT, Google used Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach. However, these approaches solely depend on the availability of a large parallel corpus of the translating language pairs. As a result, a good number of widely spoken languages such as Bengali, remain little explored in the research arena of artificial intelligence. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore improvized translation from Bengali to English. To do so, we study both the rule-based translator and the corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) in isolation, and in combination with different approaches of blending between them. More specifically, first, we adopt popular corpus-based machine translators (NMT and SMT) and a rule-based machine translator for Bengali to English translation. Next, we integrate the rule-based translator with each of the corpus-based machine translators separately using different approaches. Besides, we perform rigorous experimentation over different datasets to report the best performance score for Bengali to English translation till today by revealing a comparison among the different approaches in terms of translation performance. Finally, we discuss how our different blending approaches can be re-used for other low-resource languages. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

However, its application to languages having different structures, like the (English, Arabic) pair that interests us in this work, degrades its performance. Indeed, the limited vocabulary size required by the NMT models decreases the vocabulary coverage rate of the Arabic language, well known by its morphological richness. Likewise, long sentences present an additional challenge to NMT systems because they perform less well for longer sentences than for the shorter ones. In this paper, we provide a series of experiments to mitigate the effects of these constraints. To address the problem of out-of-vocabulary words, we integrated into factored NMT models morphosyntactic features as an output factor, namely stem, lemma, POS, root, and pattern. We have also developed two techniques for segmenting long sentences into smaller sub-sentences. The first uses a list of lexical markers that we have collected as segmentation points, and the second integrates into the NMT model the parallel phrases extracted by an SMT system. The experiments carried out on the EnglishArabic pair show that the proposed approaches considerably improve the translation quality compared to the basic NMT system. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

Recently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been an out-performing and well-established model in the task of Grammar Error Correction (GEC). Arabic GEC is still growing because of some challenges, such as scarcity of training sets and the complexity of Arabic language. To overcome these issues, we introduced an unsupervised method to generate large-scale synthetic training data based on confusion function to increase the amount of training set. Furthermore, we introduced a supervised NMT model for AGEC called SCUT AGEC. SCUT AGEC is a convolutional sequence-to-sequence model consisting of nine encoder-decoder layers with attention mechanism. We applied fine-tuning to improve the performance and get more efficient results. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) gives our model ability to joint feature extraction and classification in one task and we proved that it is an efficient way to capture features of the local context. Moreover, it is easy to obtain long-term dependencies because of convolutional layers staking. Our proposed model becomes the first supervised AGEC system based on the convolutional sequence-to-sequence learning to outperforms the current state-of-the-art neural AGEC models. © 2021"	Arabic grammar error correction; Convolutional neural networks; Natural language processing	Review	Final	"All Open Access, Gold"	Scopus	2-s2.0-85098192466

Unknown Word (UNK) tokens represent the out-of-vocabulary words for the reason that NMT systems run with vocabulary that has fixed size. Scarce words are encoded completely as sequences of subword pieces employing the Word-Piece Model. This research paper introduces the first Transformer-based neural machine translation model for Arabic vernaculars that employs subword units. The proposed solution is based on the Transformer model that has been presented lately. The use of subword units and shared vocabulary within the Arabic dialect (the source language) and modern standard Arabic (the target language) enhances the behavior of the multi-head attention sublayers for the encoder by obtaining the overall dependencies between words of input sentence for Arabic vernacular. Experiments are carried out from Levantine Arabic vernacular (LEV) to modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Maghrebi Arabic vernacular (MAG) to MSA, GulfMSA, NileMSA, Iraqi Arabic (IRQ) to MSA translation tasks. Extensive experiments confirm that the suggested model adequately addresses the unknown word issue and boosts the quality of translation from Arabic vernaculars to Modern standard Arabic (MSA). © 2021 by the authors.

In this version, we have started to translate simple sentences composed from a limited number of words since generally communication with deaf person uses short sentences. We have used the same ATLASLang MTS database of signs and we have utilized morphological characteristics to derive the maximum information from each word in the input of the neural translation system.
