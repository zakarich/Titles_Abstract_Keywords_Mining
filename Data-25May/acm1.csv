Traditionally, interaction has been performed using a keyboard and a mouse. However, the use of touchscreens has been popularised recently. Many touchscreen devices already exist in the market, namely mobile phones, laptops and tablet computers like the iPad. In this work, we propose a new interaction modality to take advantage of such devices, for which online handwritten text seems a very natural way of input. Multimodality is formulated as an extension to the traditional IMT protocol where the user can amend errors by writing text with an electronic pen or a stylus on a touchscreen. Different approaches to modality fusion have been studied. In addition, these approaches have been assessed on the Xerox task.

In this article, we propose compositional machine transliteration systems, where multiple transliteration components may be composed either to improve existing transliteration quality, or to enable transliteration functionality between languages even when no direct parallel names corpora exist between them. Specifically, we propose two distinct forms of composition: serial and parallel. Serial compositional system chains individual transliteration components, say, X → Y and Y → Z systems, to provide transliteration functionality, X → Z. In parallel composition evidence from multiple transliteration paths between X → Z are aggregated for improving the quality of a direct system. We demonstrate the functionality and performance benefits of the compositional methodology using a state-of-the-art machine transliteration framework in English and a set of Indian languages, namely, Hindi, Marathi, and Kannada. Finally, we underscore the utility and practicality of our compositional approach by showing that a CLIR system integrated with compositional transliteration systems performs consistently on par with, and sometimes better than, that integrated with a direct transliteration system.","2010-12","2021-06-23 11:36:58","2021-06-23 11:36:58","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","compositional machine transliteration; crosslingual information retrieval; Machine transliteration; multiple evidence; resource reusage; transliterability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, with simplicity and feasibility in mind, we introduce a gated cumulative attention network to replace the self-attention part in Transformer decoder to maintain the parallelization property in the inference phase. The gated cumulative attention network includes two sub-layers, a gated linearly cumulative layer that creates the relationship between already predicted tokens and current representation, and a feature fusion layer that enhances the representation with a feature fusion operation. The proposed method was evaluated on WMT17 datasets with 12 language pair groups.

In this work, we provide a hypothesis that SE corpus has inherent characteristics that NMT will confront challenges compared to the state-of-the-art translation engine based on Statistical Machine Translation. We introduce a problem which is significant in SE and has characteristics that challenges the abil- ity of NMT to learn correct sequences, called Prefix Mapping. We implement and optimize the original SMT and NMT to mitigate those challenges. By the evaluation, we show that SMT outperforms NMT for this research problem, which provides potential directions to optimize the current NMT engines for specific classes of parallel corpus.

In this study we investigate the correction of such errors, which we call corpus correction. Using machine-learning methods, we applied corpus correction to a verb modality corpus for machine translation. We used the maximum-entropy and decision-list methods as machine-learning methods. We compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments, and determined which is most effective by using a statistical test. We obtained several noteworthy findings: (1) Precision was almost the same for both detection and correction, so it is more convenient to do both correction and detection, rather than detection only. (2) In general, the maximum-entropy method worked better than the decision-list method; but the two methods had almost the same precision for the top 50 pieces of extracted data when closed data was used. (3) In terms of precision, the use of closed data was better than the use of open data; however, in terms of the total number of extracted errors, the use of open data was better than the use of closed data.

It then adopts probability-reference or cross-reference to post-process the translations, in a grey-box or black-box manner, to repair the inconsistencies. Our evaluation on two state-of-the-art translators, Google Translate and Transformer, indicates that TransRepair has a high precision (99%) on generating input pairs with consistent translations. With these tests, using automatic consistency metrics and manual assessment, we find that Google Translate and Transformer have approximately 36% and 40% inconsistency bugs. Black-box repair fixes 28% and 19% bugs on average for Google Translate and Transformer. Grey-box repair fixes 30% bugs on average for Transformer.

However, there are many choices involved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. The choices made will create a new CWS scheme, but whether it will produce a superior or inferior translation has remained unknown to date. This article examines the relationship between CWS and SMT. The effects of CWS on SMT were investigated using different specifications and CWS methods. Four specifications were selected for investigation: Beijing University (PKU), Hong Kong City University (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR), and Academia SINICA (AS). We created 16 CWS schemes under different settings to examine the relationship between CWS and SMT. Our experimental results showed that the MSR's specifications produced the lowest quality translations. In examining the effects of CWS methods, we tested dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the quality of the resulting translations. We also found the correlation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. We analyzed CWS errors and their effect on SMT by evaluating systems trained with and without these errors. This article also proposes two methods for combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated. We found these approaches were very effective in improving the quality of translations.","2008-05","2021-06-23 11:37:14","2021-06-23 11:37:14","","","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Chinese word segmentation; linear integration; statistical machine translation; translation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.","1985-01","2021-06-23 11:37:26","2021-06-23 11:37:26","","1–17","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Cambridge, MA, USA Publisher: MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, machine translation software has been shown to regularly return erroneous translations, which can lead to harmful consequences such as economic loss and political conflicts. Additionally, due to the complexity of the underlying neural models, testing machine translation systems presents new challenges. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Chinese (En-Zh). The results show that PatInv can accurately find 308 erroneous translations in Google Translate and 223 erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator, most of which cannot be found by the state-of-the-art approaches.","2020","2021-06-23 11:37:27","2021-06-23 11:37:27","","863–875","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","Machine translation; Pathological Invariance; Testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The migration process is often performed manually or semi-automatically, in which developers are required to manually define translation rules and API mappings. This paper presents semSMT, an automatic tool to migrate code written in Java to C#. semSMT utilizes statistical machine translation to automatically infer translation rules from existing migrated code, thus, requires no manual defining of rules.

People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored.To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of ""similar"" source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic.","2020","2021-06-23 11:37:28","2021-06-23 11:37:28","","961–973","","","","","","","ICSE '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, South Korea","","","","machine translation; metamorphic testing; structural invariance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering phrases that correspond to syntactic categories in the parse trees we develop techniques to augment (declare a syntactically motivated category for a phrase pair) and generalize (form mixed terminal and nonterminal phrases) the phrase table into a synchronous bilingual grammar.
