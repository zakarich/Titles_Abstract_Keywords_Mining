Because of the rigid constraints imposed by automatic machines, the formulation of translation algorithms involves unprecedented problems of a linguistic nature. Much of the existing literature in the field of machine translation consists of theoretical treatments of these problems, or of appropriately simplified abstractions from these problems. Several specific algorithms for the machine translation of Russian to English have been proposed, but none have been tested on a large scale. These rules are apparently based on the intuition and linguistic backgrounds of the individual writers, sometimes aided by the manual analysis of short text samples. Until very recently the use of automatic machines has been confined to the application of ad-hoc computer programs, tailored to the processing of particular sentences or carefully selected texts. © 1958 Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States","The logic of English grammar is being investigated by a process of approximative logical synthesis. Beginning with a kernel language which is an alphabetically spelled form of symbolic logic with English-like vocabulary, English-like extensions are constructed simulating selected features of English grammar. For each extended language, an algorithm is given which would permit a computer to make a left-to-right, word-by-word scan of an input sequence, to transform it by stages (as long as the sequence is found to be a well-formed formula of the extended language) into a sentence in the logical grammar of the kernel (or into a logical symbolization if desired). The algorithm thus constitutes simultaneously (1) a recognition grammar of the extended language, i.e., not just formation rules or productions, but a decision method for sentencehood, and (2) a portion of its transformation rules (defining a consequence relation). To date, languages have been constructed simulating the English determiners, (e.g., “every”, “any”, “no”, “a”) and the system of groupers (“either”, “both”, “if”) with precedence-ordered connectives (e.g., “and”, “and furthermore”, “or”, “or else”) by which English achieves the effect of parentheses. Work soon to be reported extends the analysis to relative, general and indefinite pronouns. It is expected that the algorithms will be embodied in computer programs within the year for purposes of comparison with results of human parsers. © 1962, ACM.

Particular emphasis is given to the system of “significant addresses” by means of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures can be substantially reduced. The description makes frequent use of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer. By structuring an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated altogether.

The history of MT, in terms of both the shift of emphasis of the philosophy of approach and the activities of the individual research groups, is briefly reviewed. A series of MT conferences organized by Wayne State University (United States) and various international conferences are discussed. The chapter also discusses the linguistic problems in MT research, components of an MT system, Wayne State University MT procedures and automatic syntactic analysis, other MT syntactic analysis techniques, surveys of MT groups since 1960, and automatic language processing committee (ALPAC) report and reactions toward it. One of the major aims of developing a functioning MT system should be to avoid mistranslations and MT research contributes to the expansion of the knowledge of how language operates. So, MT is the most important area where symbiosis between computer and man can be most successfully advanced. © 1971, Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956790426

The replacement of CODASYL system software involves two main steps: (1) In order to preserve the notions of CODASYL records, sets, areas, and others, we need a methodology for database transformation so that an existing codasyl database may be transformed into suitable formats for storing and retrieving in the database machine. (2) For the purpose of allowing existing application programs written in a CODASYL data sublanguage to store, retrieve and manipulate CODASYL data in the new environment without reprogramming, we need to be able to translate the data sublanguage calls dynamically into the commands of the database machine. Such process is termed querv translation. In this paper, a database transformation methodology and a query translation process are presented which ensure that the content-addressability and parallel read-out capability of the database machine are used to advantage. The machine in consideration is known as the database computer (DBC) and is also briefly reviewed. DBC is one of the 'typical' new back-end machines for database management which utilize the emerging hardware and the modification of existing hardware for performance gain and capacity increase. © 1978 ACM.","Codasyl data model; Database machines; Database management systems; Database transformation; Dbc; Network data model; Query translation; Relative performance","Application programs; Computer hardware; Database systems; Information management; Management information systems; Metadata; Search engines; Capacity increase; Conventional database; Database management; Database transformation; Network data; Performance Gain; Query translations; Relative performance; Query processing; Data base systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018065483

The syntactic phase of the translation process has been extensively studied and many techniques are available for automatically generating efficient parsers for context-free grammars. Attribute grammars offer the prospect of similarly automating the implementation of the semantic phase. In this paper we present a general method of constructing, for any non-circular attribute grammar, a deterministic translator which will perform the semantic evaluation of each syntax tree of the grammar in time linear with the size of the tree. Each tree is traversed in a manner particularly suited to the shape of the tree, yielding a near optimal evaluation order for that tree. Basically, the translator consists of a finite set of ""Local Control Automata"", one for each production; these are ordinary finite-state acyclic automata augmented with some special features, which are used to regulate the evaluation process of each syntax tree. With each node in the tree there will be associated the Local Control Automaton of the production applying at the node. At any given time during the translation process all Local Control Automata are inactive, except for the one associated with the currently processed node, which is responsible for directing the next steps taken by the translator until control is finally passed to a neighbour node, reactivating its Local Control Automaton. The Local Control Automata of neighbour nodes communicate with each other. The construction of the translator is custom tailored to each individual attribute grammar. The dependencies among the attributes occurring in the semantic rules are analysed to produce a near-optimal evaluation strategy for that grammar. This strategy ensures that during the evaluation process, each time the translator enters some subtree of the syntax tree, at least one new attribute evaluation will occur at each node visited. It is this property which distinguishes the method presented here from previously known methods of generating translators for unrestricted attribute grammars, and which causes the translators to be near-optimal. © 1979 ACM.",,"Automata theory; Context free grammars; Context free languages; Context sensitive grammars; Semantics; Syntactics; Translation (languages); Trees (mathematics); Attribute evaluation; Attribute grammars; Automatic Generation; General method; Neighbour nodes; Semantic evaluations; Semantic rules; Translation process; ATTRIBUTE GRAMMARS; TRANSLATORS; Process control; Automata theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018307932

It is argued that competent translation requires some reasonable depth of understanding of the source text, and, in particular, access to detailed contextual information. The following machine translation paradigm is proposed. First, the source text is analyzed and mapped into a language-free conceptual representation. Inference mechanisms then apply contextual world knowledge to augment the representation in various ways, adding information about items that were only implicit in the input text. Finally, a natural-language generator maps appropriate sections of the language-free representation into the target language. We discuss several difficult translation problems from this viewpoint with examples of English-to-Spanish and English-to-Russian translations; and illustrate possible solutions as embodied in a computer understander called SAM, which reads certain kinds of newspaper stories, then summarizes or paraphrases them in a variety of languages.

Then the components of a machine translation system are explained from the standpoint of software, linguistic components, and users' demands. The importance of pre-editing and post-editing is stressed. The semantic and contextual processings are essential to obtain a better translation quality, which are the future problems to attack. Attention is given to the difficulty of contemplating a pivot method in machine translation instead of transfer methods, because the projection from a word or a phrase to a concept is very difficult if we want to have a very exact concept representation and translation. A new transfer method which accompanies the pe-transfer structural adjustment and post-transfer adjustment is explained. This method was adopted by the Japanese governmental project of machine translation which was directed by the author. Various mechanisms of structural transformations in the transfer and generation processes are explained, which are necessitated by the language translation between the two languages of different language families like Japanese and English. Finally some comments are given from the standpoint of users of machine translation systems. Systems always are imperfect, and users must use them after recognizing the possibilities and the limitations of the system. © 1986.",,"COMPUTERS, DIGITAL - Applications; LINGUISTIC COMPONENTS; MACHINE TRANSLATION; SUBGRAMMAR NETWORK; INFORMATION SCIENCE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022730194

Here, ""virtual machine translation"" means a kind of syntax-oriented literal translation which may be regarded as an idealized competence of today's practical machine translation. The above comparison shows that the main reason for the limitation or the incompleteness of current practical machine translation systems is the insufficient ability to treat ""structural idiosyncrasies"" of sentences. Also, some translation examples tell us that, without ""understanding"" the total meaning of the source sentence, it is quite difficult to manipulate the idiosyncrasies in sentence structure. Idiosyncratic gaps between source and target sentence structure usually originate in cultural differences, so that the computational treatment of these gaps is a very difficult problem.

This increased formality allows for the automatic manipulation of software, increasing productivity, and, even more importantly, the manageability of complex systems. Along these lines, attribute grammars constitute a formal mechanism for specifying translations between languages; from a formal description of the translation a translator can be automatically constructed. In this paper we consider taking this process one step further: given an attribute grammar specifying the translation from language L1 to language L2, we address the question of whether the inverse attribute grammar specifying the inverse translation from L2 to L1 can be automatically generated. We show how to solve this problem for a restricted subset of attribute grammars. This inversion process allows for compatible two-way translators to be generated from a single description. To show the practical feasibility of attribute grammar inversion, we relate our experience in inverting an attribute grammar used as an interface for a formal database accessing language, SQL. The attribute grammar is used to paraphrase SQL database queries in English. © 1986 IEEE","Automatic software generation; bidirectional translators; formal specifications; inversion of attribute grammars; natural language interfaces to databases","COMPUTER SOFTWARE; DATABASE SYSTEMS - Query Languages; ATTRIBUTE GRAMMARS; AUTOMATIC INVERSION; SQL; TWO-WAY TRANSLATORS; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022722780

One of the principal reasons for developing this notation was to aid in the rapid construction of code generators, especially for new microprocessors. Each data descriptor contains a base, a displacement, and a level of indirection. For example, a variable x lying at displacement 28 from base register B3 is represented by this data descriptor: @B3.28. The general form of a data descriptor is @kb.d.i where k gives the number of levels of indirection, b is a base, d is a displacement, and I is an index. Data descriptors are convenient for representing addressing in Fortran (with static allocation and common blocks), in Pascal and Turing (with automatic allocation and stack frames), and in more general languages such as Euclid and PL/I. This generality of data descriptors allows code generation to be largely independent of the source language. Data descriptors are able to encode the addressing modes of typical computer architectures such as the IBM 360 and the PDP-11. This generality of data descriptors allows code generation to be largely machine independent. This paper gives a machine independent method of storage allocation that uses data descriptors. Techniques are given for local optimization of basic arithmetic and addressing code using data descriptors. Target machine dependencies are isolated so that the part of the code generator that handles high-level addressing (such as subscripting) is machine independent. The techniques described in this paper have proven effective in the rapid development of a number of production code generators. © 1987, ACM.

Box 1892, Houston, TX 77251-1892, United States","The recent success of vector computers such as the Cray-1 and array processors such as those manufactured by Floating Point Systems has increased interest in making vector operations available to the FORTRAN programmer. The FORTRAN standards committee is currently considering a successor to FORTRAN 77, usually called FORTRAN 8x, that will permit the programmer to explicitly specify vector and array operations. Although FORTRAN 8x will make it convenient to specify explicit vector operations in new programs, it does little for existing code. In order to benefit from the power of vector hardware, existing programs will need to be rewritten in some language (presumably FORTRAN 8x) that permits the explicit specification of vector operations. One way to avoid a massive manual recoding effort is to provide a translator that discovers the parallelism implicit in a FORTRAN program and automatically rewrites that program in FORTRAN 8x. Such a translation from FORTRAN to FORTRAN 8x is not straightforward because FORTRAN DO loops are not always semantically equivalent to the corresponding FORTRAN 8x parallel operation. The semantic difference between these two constructs is precisely captured by the concept of dependence. A translation from FORTRAN to FORTRAN 8x preserves the semantics of the original program if it preserves the dependences in that program. The theoretical background is developed here for employing data dependence to convert FORTRAN programs to parallel form. Dependence is defined and characterized in terms of the conditions that give rise to it; accurate tests to determine dependence are presented; and transformations that use dependence to uncover additional parallelism are discussed. © 1987, ACM.

This approach is practical, but misleading, unless domain knowledge is highly integrated in the system. Another way to indicate which fragments of language the system can process is to state its grammatical potentials, or more formally, which languages the grammars of the system can generate. This approach is more technical and less understandable to the layman (customer), but it is less misleading, since it stresses the point that the fragments which can be translated by the grammars of a system need not necessarily coincide exactly with any particular genre. Generally, the syntactic and lexical rules of an MT system allow it to translate many sentences other than those belonging to a certain genre. On the other hand it probably cannot translate all the sentences of a particular genre. Swetra is a multilanguage MT system defined by the potentials of a formal grammar (standard referent grammar) and not by reference to a genre. Successful translation of sentences can be guaranteed if they are within a specified syntactic format based on a specified lexicon. The paper discusses the consequences of this approach (Grammatically Restricted Machine Translation, GRMT) and describes the limits set by a standard choice of grammatical rules for sentences and clauses, noun phrases, verb phrases, sentence adverbials, etc. Such rules have been set up for English, Swedish and Russian, mainly on the basis of familiarity (frequency) and computer efficiency, but restricting the grammar and making it suitable for several languages poses many problems for optimization.

Slot Grammar makes a systematic use of slots (essentially syntactic relations) obtained from lexical entries for head words of phrases. No phrase structure rules (augmented or plain) are used Instead, there are slot filler rules and separately stated ordering rules for slots. A great deal of the Slot Grammar system is in the shell. This includes most of the treatment of coordination, which uses a method of 'factoring out' unfilled slots from elliptical coordinated phrases. The parser (a bottom-up chart parser) employs a parse evaluation scheme used for pruning away unlikely analyses during parsing as well as for ranking final analyses The transfer step is designed so that all of the transfer rules except those arising from lexical transfer entries (which are database-like) are in the shell Syntactic generation uses a system of transformations, written in a formalism involving an extension of Prolog unification The revision includes a new treatment of transformation rule ordering.

The model includes the machine translation and the error correction mechanisms. By the machine translation mechanism, the system can receive the input from the student and return the translation or instruct the syntax. When an incorrect sentence is given from the student, the machine utilizes the error‐correction mechanism to analyze the sentence and instruct how the error is produced. The curriculum for the CAI system is placed outside the system as a dedicated text, and the user is free to choose the test. Based on such a model, the authors have developed a CAI system (English CAI) to teach English to the junior high school student. The system is actually operated in an educational situation. A field test is demonstrated in which the mechanisms for machine translation and error‐correction functioned effectively as a means to answer questions, providing a good assistance to learning.

Software has been implemented and tested within the Hull University Nomenclature Translator so that the latter can handle submitted names found to be syntactically or semantically incorrect. A preprocessing stage before parsing removes many minor errors in punctuation. More substantial errors of syntax are detected during parsing and then processed. Errors in punctuation may be corrected by modifying the grammar rules to accept particular cases of erroneous syntax, which is then corrected by semantic code associated with the rules. However, this proved to be practicable for only a few constructions. The more general approach adopted involves a combination of spell-checking suspect fragments to find similarly spelled or sounding fragments, known to the translator, and referencing the grammar tables to determine whether any of these are acceptable in the context of the parsing to that point. Nonserious semantic faults are easily corrected, but faults with the magnitudes of locants and with their associated multiplying terms need interaction with the user. A successful correction rate of 70% was achieved on a small sample of externally generated incorrect names. The conclusion is that it is possible to semiautomatically correct, that is with some user interaction, many of the errors commonly made in systematic nomenclature.

To facilitate the development of relational grammar generators, we have built a generator shell that provides a high-level relational grammar rule-writing language and is independent of both the natural language and the application. The implemented English generator (called GENIE) maps abstract canonical structures, representing the basic predicate-argument structures of sentences, into well-formed English sentences via a two-stage plan-and-execute design. The modularity inherent in the plan-and-execute design permits the development of a very general and stable deterministic execution grammar. Another major feature of the GENIE generator is that it is category-driven, i.e., planning rules and execution rules are distributed over a part-of-speech hierarchy (down to individual lexical items) and are invoked via an inheritance mechanism only if appropriate for the category being processed. Categorydriven processing facilitates the handling of exceptions. The use of a syntactic planner and category-driven processing together provide a great deal of flexibility without sacrificing determinism in the generation process. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","generation; natural language processing; relational grammar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248850099

Examples are shown for each type of ambiguity and sometimes for subtypes. Ambiguity resolution strategies used in the ALICE machine translation system are presented in various levels of detail. A disambiguation model, called Four-Step, is proposed for resolving syntactic ambiguities involving serial verb construction and predication. As the name suggests, the model comprises four steps-well-formedness checking, preference for argument readings, precondition checking, and late closure. For resolving semantic ambiguity, we propose a new formalism, called Semantic Functional Grammar (SFG), to deal with the resolution problem. SFG integrates the concept of Semantic Grammar into Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) such that the functional structure (f-structures) include semantic functions in addition to grammatical functions. For dealing with lexical and contextual ambiguities, we briefly describe the mechanisms used in the ALICE system. As for morphological ambiguity, the resolution is a problem of word-boundary decision (segmentation) and is beyond the scope of this research.

The model is intended to be extensible to realms outside of the temporal domain (e.g., the spatial domain). The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection process during generation: there is often a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect possibilities that may be produced from a lexical semantic representation, which, as defined in the model presented here, is largely underspecified. Temporal/aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-language terms limit the possibilities for generation of tense and aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1992.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Knowledge representation; Pinch effect; Translation (languages); Lexical semantics; Machine translations; Source language; Spatial domains; Target language; Temporal domain; Two way communications; Two-level models; Semantics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029752939

This control rests on the appropriate construction of abstract specifications of meaning that can guide the generation process to produce language that is textually, grammatically, and lexically appropriate. Such abstract semantic specifications, when constructed in the right way, preserve much of the meaning required in a translation without unduly constraining syntactic form. This is potentially of great value for machine translation since it opens up the possibility of domain-independent, constrained, meaning-based translation. This paper describes how the upper model of the PENMAN text generation system provides a level of semantic abstraction of this kind. It offers examples of the motivation of broader sets of likely translational equivalents than that possible with transfers at lower-levels of abstraction and sets out types of constraints by which the set of likely translational equivalents may be reduced to high-quality renderings of the source text. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","meaning-based translation; semantics; systematics; text generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248834659

Two claims made here are that the current representation handles many distinctions (or divergences) across languages without recourse to language-specific rules and that the lexical-semantic framework provides the basis for a systematic mapping between the interlingua and the syntactic structure. The representation adopted is an extended version of lexical conceptual structure which is suitable to the task of translating between divergent structures for two reasons: (1) it provides an abstraction of language-independent properties from structural idiosyncrasies; and (2) it is compositional in nature. The lexical-semantic approach addresses the divergence problem by using a linguistically grounded mapping that has access to parameter settings in the lexicon. We will examine a number of relevant issues including the problem of defining primitives, the issue of interlinguality, the cross-linguistic coverage of the system, and the mapping between the syntactic structure and the interlingua.

It describes a simple and efficient algorithm for generating text which has been developed for use in machine translation, but will have wider application in natural language processing. An important property of the algorithm is that the logical form used to generate a sentence need not be one which could have been produced by parsing the sentence: formal equivalence between logical forms is allowed for. This is necessary for a machine translation system, such as the one envisaged in this paper, which uses single declarative grammars of individual languages, and declarative statements of translation equivalences for transfer. In such a system, it cannot be guaranteed that transfer will produce a logical form in the same order as would have been produced by parsing some target-language sentence, and it is not practicable to define a normal form for the logical forms. The algorithm is demonstrated using a categorial grammar and a simple indexed logic, as this allows a particularly clear and elegant formulation. It is shown that the algorithm can be adapted to phrase-structure grammars, and to more complex semantic representations than that used here. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","generation; generation algorithm; indexed logic; Machine translation; tactical generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645960795

A survey of the literature on evaluation of MT systems seems to suggest that the success of the evaluation often depends very strongly on the selection of an appropriate application. If the application is well-chosen, then it often becomes fairly clear how the system should be evaluated. Moreover, the evaluation is likely to make the system look good. Conversely, if the application is not clearly identified (or worse, if the application is poorly chosen), then it is often very difficult to find a satisfying evaluation paradigm. We begin our discussion with a brief review of some evaluation metrics that have been tried in the past and conclude that it is difficult to identify a satisfying evaluation paradigm that will make sense over all possible applications. It is probably wise to identify the application first, and then we will be in a much better position to address evaluation questions. The discussion will then turn to the main point, an essay on how to pick a good niche application for state-of-the-art (crummy) machine translation. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","evaluation criteria; MT evaluation; post-editing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000804637

In previous work, the definition of the transduction relation defined by a synchronous TAG was given by appeal to an iterative rewriting process. The rewriting definition of derivation is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the formalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not impossible. We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous tree‐adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard tree‐adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and implementability problems of the original rewriting definition. The decrease in expressivity, which would otherwise make the method unusable, is offset by the incorporation of an alternative definition of standard tree‐adjoining derivation, previously proposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to entertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless, some remaining problematic cases call for yel more flexibility in the definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed. It remains for future research to rune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Then, we give the details of the translation algorithm, and discuss its implementation issues. And finally, we discuss the limitations of this tool and problems encountered during this work. © 1994 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; C (programming language); Computer aided language translation; Computer hardware description languages; Computer simulation; Management information systems; Object oriented programming; Telecommunication services; User interfaces; Automatic translation; Guidelines for the definition at managed objects; Translation algorithms; Telecommunication networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028479830

We introduce the system ATRACT, which is a semi-automatic knowledge acquisition tool designed to facilitate the construction of the desired translation rules through the use of inductive machine learning techniques. Rather than building rules by hand from scratch, a user of ATRACT can obtain good candidate rules by providing the system with a collection of examples of Japanese sentences along with their English translations. This learning task is characterized by two factors: (i) It involves exploiting a huge amount of semantic information as background knowledge. (ii) Training examples are 'ambiguous'. Currently, two learning methods are available in ATRACT. Experiments show that these methods lead to rules that are very close to those composed manually by human experts given only a reasonable number of examples. These results suggest that ATRACT will significantly contribute to reducing the cost and improving the quality of ALT-J/E translation rules.",,"Computational linguistics; Costs; Data acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Pattern recognition; Systems analysis; User interfaces; Inductive learning technique; Knowledge acquisition tool; Machine learning; Machine translation rule; Semantic information; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028195499

We present the process of anaphora resolution implemented in the Machine Translation system fast and show how the dl system back is used to support disambiguation. The disambiguation strategy uses factors representing syntactic, semantic, and conceptual constraints with different weights to choose the most adequate antecedent candidate. We show how these factors can be declaratively represented as defaults in back. Disambiguation is then achieved by determining the interpretation that yields a qualitatively minimal number of exceptions to the defaults, and can thus be formalized as exception minimization. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Anaphora resolution; description logics; disambiguation; machine translation","Computational linguistics; Data handling; Data structures; Formal logic; Natural language processing systems; Program translators; Ambiguity; Anaphora resolution; Description logics; Disambiguation; Machine translation; Surface syntactic structures; Target language; Knowledge based systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028371910

To our knowledge, these are the first empirical results of the kind between an Indo-European and non-Indo-European language for any significant vocabulary and corpus size. The learned vocabulary size is about 6,500 English words, achieving translation precision in the 86-96% range, with alignment proceeding at paragraph, sentence, and word levels. Specifically, we report (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, (2) experiments supporting the usefulness of restricted lexical cues for statistical paragraph and sentence alignment, and (3) experiments that question the role of hand-derived monolingual lexicons for automatic word translation acquisition. Using a hand-derived monolingual lexicon, the learned translation lexicon averages 2.33 Chinese translations per English entry, with a manually-filtered precision of 95.1%, and an automatically-filtered weighted precision of 86.0%. We then introduce a fully automatic two-stage statistical methodology that is able to learn translations for collocations. A statistically-learned monolingual Chinese lexicon is first used to segment the Chinese text, before applying bilingual training to produce 6,429 English entries with 2.25 Chinese translations per entry. This method improves the manually-filtered precision to 96.0% and the automatically-filtered weighted precision to 91.0%, an error rate reduction of 35.7% from using a hand-derived monolingual lexicon. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","English-Chinese machine translation; lexical acquisition; parallel corpus; statistical and corpus-based NLP; translation lexicon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248801901

Systems like KBMT-89 and its descendents have demonstrated how knowledge-based translation can produce good results in technical domains with tractable domain semantics. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the development task for large-scale applications with tens of thousands of domain concepts precludes a purely hand-crafted approach. The current challenge for the ""next generation"" of knowledge-based MT systems is to utilize on-line textual resources and corpus analysis software in order to automate the most laborious aspects of the knowledge acquisition process. This partial automation can in turn maximize the productivity of human knowledge engineers and help to make large-scale applications of knowledge-based MT an viable approach. In this paper we discuss the corpus-based knowledge acquisition methodology used in KANT, a knowledge-based translation system for multilingual document production. This methodology can be generalized beyond the KANT interlingua approach for use with any system that requires similar kinds of knowledge. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","conceptual coverage; knowledge-based machine translation; lexical mapping; on-line lexical acquisition; phrasal substructure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004597193

This paper focuses on the construction of a large ontology (or knowledge base, or world model) for supporting KBMT. It contains representations for some 70,000 commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods (e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another.

The knowledge utilized by these systems has been incorporated into a context‐based machine translation system (CONTRAST) developed by the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL). The Japanese language analysis component of the CONTRAST system consists of individual modules to analyze syntax, semantics and context. The syntactic analysis module is a completely parallel parsing system based on Earley's algorithm. The semantic analysis module conducts analysis based on case relations. The contextual analysis module creates an intermediate representation that correspond to original text. It does this by placing events included in the semantic analysis results for each individual sentence within a framework that is read out from the general knowledge described as a process model in the concept dictionary. The English text generation system of CONTRAST begins with this intermediate representation. Then, referring to the concept dictionary (common with the analysis module), it creates English text according to generation rules created from the real life text data dependent knowledge relating to English newspaper articles. The format of the concept dictionary, which consists of descriptions of general knowledge, and the format of the intermediate representation, which is a description of the contextual information contained in each body of text, are the same. The outline of the conceptual system employed and studies on the process of creating this system are also discussed.

Usually, it is difficult to determine uniquely the attachment of the prepositional phrase only by the syntactic analysis. Since the prepositional phrase appears with a high frequency, it is a very important problem in English analysis to disambiguate the attachment. In the machine translation, for example, the translation of the preposition and consequently the translation of the whole sentence become unnatural if the attachment of the prepositional phrase is not correctly identified. This paper proposes the Example‐Based Disambiguation (EBD) method, which is composed of the following processes: (1) examples (prepositional phrase and its attachment) are extracted from the corpus; (2) the semantic distance between the input expression and the example is calculated according to the thesaurus; and (3) the attachment of the prepositional phrase is disambiguated using the example with the minimum distance. Through the comparison experiment between the proposed method and the conventional method, it is shown that the former is better in terms of the success rate in the determination of the prepositional phrase attachment.

One of the primary stumbling blocks to this promise has been the lack of tools to translate application codes to MPP form. In this article we show how applications codes written in a subset of Fortran 77, called Fortran-P, can be translated to achieve good performance on several massively parallel machines. This subset can express codes that are self-similar, where the algorithm applied to the global data domain is also applied to each subdomain. We have found many codes that match the Fortran-P programming style and have converted them using our tools. We believe a self-similar coding style will accomplish what a vectorizable style has accomplished for vector machines by allowing the construction of robust, user-friendly, automatic translation systems that increase programmer productivity and generate fast, efficient code for MPPs. © 1995, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029270709

We begin by examining the interlinguas in the lexicons of a variety of current IL-based approaches to MT. This brief survey makes it clear that no consensus exists among MT researchers on the level of representation for defining the IL. In the section that follows, we explore the consequences of this missing formal framework for MT system builders who develop their own lexical-IL entries. The lack of software tools to support rapid IL respecification and testing greatly hampers their ability to modify representations to handle new data and new domains. Our view is that IL-based MT research needs both (a) the formal framework to specify possible IL grammars and (b) the software support tools to implement and test these grammars. With respect to (a), we propose adopting a lexicalized grammar approach, tapping research results from the study of tree grammars for natural language syntax. With respect to (b), we sketch the design and functional specifications for parts of ILustrate, the set of software tools that we need to implement and test the various IL formalisms that meet the requirements of a lexicalized grammar. In this way, we begin to address a basic issue in MT research, how to define and test an interlingua as a computational language - without building a full MT system for each possible IL formalism that might be proposed. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","interlingua; lexicalized grammar; lexicon; machine translation","Algorithms; Computational grammars; Computer aided software engineering; Data handling; Formal languages; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Specifications; Interlinguas; Lexicalized grammar; Lexicon; Machine translation; Tree grammars; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029516519

Therefore, efforts have been made to transform machine generated proofs (e.g. resolution proofs) into natural deduction (ND) proofs. The state-of-the-art procedure of proof transformation follows basically its completeness proof: the premises and the conclusion are decomposed into unit literals, then the theorem is derived by multiple levels of proofs by contradiction. Indeterminism is introduced by heuristics that aim at the production of more elegant results. This indeterministic character entails not only a complex search, but also leads to unpredictable results. In this paper we first study resolution proofs in terms of meaningful operations employed by human mathematicians, and thereby establish a correspondence between resolution proofs and ND proofs at a more abstract level. Concretely, we show that if its unit initial clauses are CNFs of literal premises of a problem, a unit resolution corresponds directly to a well-structured ND proof segment that mathematicians intuitively understand as the application of a definition or a theorem. The consequence is twofold: First it enhances our intuitive understanding of resolution proofs in terms of the vocabulary with which mathematicians talk about proofs. Second, the transformation process is now largely deterministic and therefore efficient. This determinism also guarantees the quality of resulting proofs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957866198

Some issues related to the synchrony assumption of the Esterel language are highlighted. We claim that it is possible to obtain asynchronous features (e.g. lengthening actions and memorized events) while keeping the benefits of the synchronous approach (e.g. proofs on the correctness of behaviors). From this comparison, principles are derived in order to translate the asynchronous Electre programs into the common code of the reactive languages (using the Esterel synchronous language). Furthermore, the idea of a mixed programming style is presented. It makes it possible to write programs consisting with a synchronous part together with an asynchronous part.

We show how the syntax-semantics relation can be used to develop a lexical acquisition approach that contributes both toward the enrichment of existing online resources and toward the development of lexicons containing more complete information than is provided in any of these resources alone. We start by describing the structure of the LCS and showing how this representation is used in FLT and MT. We then focus on the problem of building LCS dictionaries for large-scale FLT and MT. First, we describe authoring tools for manual and semi-automatic construction of LCS dictionaries; we then present a more sophisticated approach that uses linguistic techniques for building word definitions automatically. These techniques have been implemented as part of a set of lexicon-development tools used in the MILT FLT project.","Foreign language tutoring; Interlingual MT; Lexical acquisition; Semantic verb classes; Syntactic codes","Computational linguistics; Computer aided instruction; Data acquisition; Interactive computer systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Terminology; Foreign language tutoring (FLT); Interlingual machine translation (MT) systems; Large scale dictionary construction; Lexical conceptual structure (LCS); Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031363773

In such the system, the high degree of incrementality is also strongly required rather than that of quality. This paper proposes an incremental machine translation system, which translates English spoken words into Japanese in accordance with the order of appearances of them. The system is composed of three modules: incremental parsing, transfer and generation, which work synchronously. The transfer module utilizes some features and phenomena characterizing Japanese spoken language: flexible wordorder, ellipses, repetitions and so forth. This is influenced by the observational facts that such characteristics frequently appear in Japanese uttered by English-Japanese interpreters. Their frequent utilization is the key to success of the exceedingly incremental translation between English and Japanese, which have different word-order. We have implemented a prototype system Sync/ Trans, which parses English dialogues incrementally and generates Japanese immediately. To evaluate Sync/Trans we have made an experiment with the conversations consisting of 27 dialogues and 218 sentences. 190 of the sentences are correct, providing a success rate of 87.2%. This result shows our incremental method to be a promising technique for spoken language translation with acceptable accuracy and high real-time nature.","incremental interpretation; Japanese spoken language; linguistic phenomena; Machine translation","Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Incremental machine translation systems; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031274434

As an alternative approach, we have developed an MT method taking advantage of the connectivity relationship between words, instead of using syntactic and semantic analysis. Our MT method converts the source language into the target language by permuting translated words based on the unique relationships among individual words and hence has the advantage that it uses only morphemic information. To demonstrate our method, we present results from an experimental translation system constructed on a personal computer, in which 200 sentences extracted from IEICE Transactions are translated.

A theoretically promising but hitherto largely unsuccessful alternative to postediting for this application is interactive machine translation (IMT), in which the translator and MT system work in tandem. We argue that past failures to make IMT viable as a tool for skilled translators have been the result of an infelicitous mode of interaction rather than any inherent flaw in the idea. As a solution, we propose a new style of IMT in which the target text under construction serves as the medium of communication between an MT system and its user.

However, translation result of an automatic MT system is often not satisfactory for this purpose and requires post-editing. In addition, a purely rule-based system does not necessarily provide a satisfactory result for specific expressions because of lack of corresponding rules, nor purely example-based system for expressions not covered by examples. A hybrid approach is worthwhile to pursuit, where automatic and interactive approaches, as well as rule-oriented and data-oriented approaches are integrated. In this article, we propose a hybrid interactive machine translation method that combines rule-based, corpus-based and example-based approach with an interactive man-machine interface. We show that the previously proposed rule-based model can be naturally integrated with different translation paradigms. The interactive operations, previously introduced and shown to be useful for disambiguation in the rule-based transfer, are shown to be also useful to control covering by and selection of the matching examples, two major decisions in the example-based translation method.

This method forms the basis of a very simple Java-based user interface that enables a language expert to build lexical and syntactic transfer knowledge bases without extensive specialized training as an MT system builder. Following [Wu 1997], we assume that the permutation of binary-branching structures is a sufficient reordering mechanism for MT. Our syntactic knowledge is based on a novel, highly constrained grammar construction environment in which the only re-ordering mechanism is the permutation of binary-branching structures (Twisted Pair Grammar).

In this field we created a work environment for monolingual translator1. This package of tools generally enables a user who masters a source language to translate texts to a target language which the user does not master. The application is for Hebrew-to-Russian case, emphasizing specific problems of these languages, but it can be adapted for other pairs of languages also. After Source Text Preparation, Morphological Analysis provides all the meanings for every word. The ambiguity problem is very serious in languages with incomplete writing, like Hebrew. But the main problem is the translation itself. Words’ meanings mapping between languages is M:M, i.e., almost every source word has a number of possible translations, and almost every target word can be a translation of several words. Many methods for resolving of these ambiguities propose using large data bases, like dictionaries with semantic fields based on θ-theory. The amount of information needed to deal with general texts is prohibitively large. We propose here to solve ambiguities by a new method: Accumulation with Inversion and then Weighted Selection, plus Learning, using only two regular dictionaries: from source to target and from target to source languages. The method is built from a number of phases: (1) during Accumulation with Inversion, all the possible translations to the target language of every word are brought, and every one of them is translated back to the source language; (2) Selection of suitable suggestions is being made by user in source language, this is the only manual phase; (3) Weighting of the selection’s results is being made by software and determines the most suitable translation to the target language; (4) Learning of word’s context will provide preferable translation in the future. Target Text Generation is based on morphological records in target language, that are produced by the disambiguation phase. To complete the missing features for word’s building, we propose here a method of Features Expansion. This method is based on assumptions about feature flow through the sentence, and on dependence of grammatical phenomena in the two languages. Software of the workstation combines four tools: Source Text Preparation, Morphological Analysis, Disambiguation and Target Text Generation. The application includes an elaborated windows interface, on which the user’s work is based. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.","Machine translation; Monolingual user; Translator workstation","Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Amount of information; Computer-aided translations; Machine translations; Monolingual user; Morphological analysis; Specific problems; Translator workstation; Weighted selections; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947770896

Some players require help in presenting their information to an international audience, others require help in finding the information they seek and, because the Internet is increasingly multilingual, help in understanding that which they find.

The number of not-translated words in a document is used as one measure in the evaluation of MT systems. Many MT developers agree that in order to reduce the number of NTWs in their systems, designers must increase the size or coverage of the lexicon to include these untranslated tokens, so that the system can handle them in future processing. While we accept this method for enhancing MT capabilities, in assessing the nature of NTWs in real-world documents, we found surprising results. Our study looked at the NTW output from two commercially available MT systems (Systran and Globalink) and found that lexical coverage played a relatively small role in the words marked as not translated. In fact, 45% of the tokens in the list failed to translate for reasons other than that they were valid source language words not included in the MT lexicon. For instance, e-mail addresses, words already in the target language and acronyms were marked as not-translated words. This paper presents our analysis of NTWs and uses these results to argue that in addition to lexicon enhancement, MT systems could benefit from more sophisticated pre- and postprocessing of real-world documents in order to weed out such NTWs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.",,"Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; E-mail address; Lexical coverage; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Real-world; Source language; Target language; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947727829

A detailed algorithm is proposed for determining the referentiality of Japanese NPs, based on a defeasible hierarchy of pragmatic rules that are applied top-down, from the clause to the NP. We also sketch the process of generating determiners and number using rules based on the different NP referentialities for a Japanese-English MT system.

A left-right tree is a tree that differentiates between left children and right children. An English sentence is transformed into a set of left-right trees by labeling each node of the left-right tree with an English word. To represent a language, which is a collection of such left-right trees, we define a grammar for left-right tree languages, called the ""tree categorical grammar."" We also define the valenced pushdown transducer as a formalized model of the parser used in the translator. Due to the valence property of the symbols, the work of the stack is restricted in the pushdown transducer. We demonstrate the equivalence of the classes of left-right tree languages produced by different representations and explain some of the properties satisfied by the classes. © 1998 Scripta Technica.","Categorical grammar; Formal language; Machine translation; Tree automaton","Context free grammars; Data structures; Formal languages; Transducers; Left right tree languages; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032072014

The features, which are invariant to changes in rotation, position and shifts, although not to changes in scale, are optimized through the use of feature selection techniques. The classification stage takes as its inputs the multidimensional multiple observation sequences and parameterizes them statistically using continuous density models to capture the target and background appearance variability.

The proposed MT model brings together knowledge in two forms: rules and examples. This system is intended for domains that are understood well but not completely perfect. Expert and heuristic knowledge in the form of rules are incorporated to provide a skeletal method for solving problems. Examples are then used to flesh out the method by covering idiosyncrasies and special cases that are not anticipated by the rules. In addition to a reasonably accurate and efficient set of rules to serve as a starting point for problem solving, the system is provided with some specific similarity measurement for critical analysis of Chinese sentences.

Nevertheless, each of these approaches contains elements which if properly harnessed should lead to an overall improvement in translation performance. It is in this new hybrid spirit that our search for a better solution to the problems of MT can be seen. We summarize the original DOP model of Bod, as well as the DOT model of translation of Poutsma on which it is based. We demonstrate that DOT is not guaranteed to produce the correct translation, despite provably deriving the most probable translation. We go on to critically evaluate previous attempts at LFG-MT, commenting briefly on particular problem cases for such systems. We then show how the LFG-DOP model of Bod and Kaplan can be extended to serve as a novel hybrid model for MT which promises to improve upon DOT, as well as the pure LFG-based translation model. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Data-oriented parsing; Hybrid machine translation; Lexical functional grammar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22844456664

After aligned sentence pairs unsuitable for rule extraction because of analysis errors or free translations are automatically rejected, zero pronouns in the Japanese sentences and the English translation equivalents of their antecedents are extracted from the remaining Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs using ten hand-developed alignment rules. This method identifies all Japanese zero pronouns whose translation equivalents are not explicitly expressed in an English sentence, this method identifies these as unalignable. Then, resolution rules for the remaining zero pronouns are automatically extracted using the aligned pairs, equivalent word/phrase pairs extracted from the aligned sentence pairs, and the syntactic and semantic structures of the Japanese sentences. This method was implemented in a Japanese-English MT system, ALT-J/E. 98.4% of all pairs were automatically aligned correctly in a window test, and 94.0% in a blind test. Furthermore, extracted rules for zero pronouns with deictic references created automatically from sentence pairs correctly resolved 99.0% of the zero pronouns in a window test and 85.0% of the zero pronouns in a blind test.","Alignment; Anaphora resolution; Bilingual corpus; English; Japanese; MT; Rule extraction; Zero pronouns","Error analysis; Semantics; Syntactics; Machine resolution (MT); Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033278410

There is consensus that anaphora resolution should rely on prior sentences within the context of the discourse. We propose to cast anaphora resolution as a semantic inference process in which a combination of multiple strategies, each exploiting different aspects of linguistic knowledge, is employed to provide a coherent resolution of anaphora. A framework which encompasses several salient linguistic parameters such as grammatical role, proximity, repetition, sentence recency and semantic cues is demonstrated. This work also shows how an anaphora-resolution algorithm can be embedded within a framework which captures all the above salient parameters, as well as remedies some of the inadequacies found in any monolithic resolution system. A language-neutral semantic representation characterized by semantic cues is presented in order to capture the distilled information after resolution. The effectiveness of the language-neutral representation, both for machine translation and anaphora resolution, is demonstrated through a set of simulations and evaluations.","Anaphora resolution; Computational framework; Machine translation; Semantic inferences","Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Semantics; Syntactics; Machine translation; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033278320

In many cases, such legacy code is written in a mainframe-specific assembly language and needs to be translated to a high-level language in order to be run on different architectures. Our research addresses this problem in a large-scale, real-life case study. We built an automatic tool, called Bogart, that translates IBM 370 assembly language programs to C. Bogart is based on Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques such as the Plan Calculus, translation by abstraction and re-implementation, program transformations, constraint propagation, and pattern recognition. Bogart was tested on real legacy code of a large commercial application: a database system and application generator, the main product of Sapiens International, Ltd. Bogart is compared with the literal brute-force translator initially developed by Sapiens, and is found to be superior on all counts, including portability of the resulting code, the amount of manual preparation required, and code size and speed. The results are shown for several small examples as well as a typical module consisting of several thousand lines of code from the Sapiens application. Bogart also seems to be more comprehensive than other reengineering systems reported in the literature. Bogart's analysis technology has recently been applied with significant commercial success to the analysis and remediation of Year 2000 bugs. This study demonstrates that certain AI techniques can be carefully combined to create industrialstrength applications that solve acute problems of Software Engineering. The fact that the research was carried out in industry on a real test case also revealed some of the problems of this approach. One example is the higher development cost of the AI approach, and the further effort that will be needed in order to extend it. (On the other hand, the literal translator has reached the end of its road, and cannot be enhanced at all.) Another problem we discovered is the difficulty of debugging the code produced by Bogart. The literal translator preserved the structure of the original program, whereas Bogart abstracted the code in various ways. As a result, the original assembly-language programmers found it harder to debug Bogart's code. This reaffirms the need for an explanation facility in intelligent applications. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The size and quality of the lexicon, as well as the coverage of the lexicon for a particular use, greatly influence the applicability of machine translation for a user. The high cost of lexicon development limits the extent to which even mature machine translation vendors can expand and specialize their lexicons, and frequently prevents users from building extensive lexicons at all. To address the high cost of lexicography for machine translation, L&H is building a Lexicography Toolkit that includes tools that can significantly improve the process of creating custom lexicons. The toolkit is based on the concept of using automatic methods of data acquisition, using text corpora, to generate lexicon entries. Of course, lexicon entries must be accurate, so the work of the toolkit must be checked by human experts at several stages. However, this checking mostly consists of removing erroneous results, rather than adding data and entire entries. This article will explore how the Lexicography Toolkit would be used to create a lexicon that is specific to the user's domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data acquisition; Linguistics; Automatic method; High costs; Human expert; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; S-domain; Text corpora; Translation lexicons; Machine components",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943144563

For this purpose, the use of machine translation is an effective approach. However, computational cost is prohibitive in translating large-scale document collections. To resolve this problem, we propose a two-stage CLIR method. First, we translate a given query into the document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign documents. Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user language, and re-rank them based on the translation result. We also show the effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese queries and English technical documents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Computational costs; Cross-language information retrieval; Document collection; Machine translations; Technical documents; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943139651

On the contrary, we argue that it is worthwhile and necessary to analyse the behaviour of translators in order to fit the tools to their needs. This paper presents an experiment to incorporate human translators' expertise into an already constructed lexical system. We focus on the design methodology that could be applied for the improvement of other similar tools.","Dictionaries; Lexical knowledge base; Machine-aided translation","Computer software; Handbooks; Human computer interaction; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Dictionaries; Human translators; Lexical knowledge base; Machine aided translation; Translator oriented dictionary systems; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034537717

The standard technique for Java execution is interpretation, which provides for extensive portability of programs. A Java interpreter dynamically executes Java bytecodes, which comprise the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution time performance of Java programs can be improved through compilation, possibly at the expense of portability. Various types of Java compilers have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile bytecodes into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers that directly translate the Java source code into the target processor's native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization, dynamic compilation, and executing Java programs in parallel, attempt to improve Java run-time performance while maintaining Java's portability. Another alternative for executing Java programs is a Java processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware. In this survey, we discuss the basic features, and the advantages and disadvantages, of the various Java execution techniques. We also discuss the various Java benchmarks that are being used by the Java community for performance evaluation of the different techniques. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the performance of the alternative Java execution techniques based on reported results.

Digital Libraries (DLs) are one of the emerging fields of study in computer science and one of the more interesting multidisciplinary research areas. Knowledge distribution is one of its main objectives; hence, the need to develop multilingual applications that make knowledge available to every community that cannot communicate in the language in which DLs material and services where implemented.

Now 50 years old, this field is one of the oldest non-numerical applications of computers. Over the years, MT has been a focus of investigations by linguists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, and engineers. It is not an exaggeration to state that early work on MT contributed very significantly to the development of such fields as computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and application-oriented natural language processing. Advances in Computers has followed the development of MT closely; a seminal article on MT by Yehoshua Bar Hillel was published in its very first issue.

However most existing machine translation systems reject utterances including irregular expressions. In order to improve the quality of translation and to make the machine translation systems easier to tune to the needs of different users, we propose a new Multi-Engine based Machine Translation approach. In the approach, several different types of translation engine as following are used in original language analysis and target language generation processing simultaneously. (I) Role based Translation Engine, (II) Example Based Translation Engine, (III) Family Modal based Translation Engine, and (IV) Super Function based Translation Engine. It is very difficult to select the best result when more than one translation engines are successful and the results are difference in traditional multi-engines method. To address the multi-selection problem, we propose a WMV (weighted maximum value) algorithm. The weight of each engine is decided by our experience and statistical information. A prototype system based on the proposed method is built and some experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper is effective for the implement of robust machine translation and the development of practical machine translation system.","Machine translation; Multi-Engine; Natural Language; Robust","Information analysis; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Parallel processing systems; Problem solving; Robustness (control systems); Machine translation; Multi-engines; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642292595

A multiple engine MT system consists of several MT engines running in parallel, coordinated by a controller. Each engine is implemented using an existing MT technique and has its own characteristics. When translating a sentence, each engine translates it independently. If more than one engine translates the sentence successfully, the controller chooses the best translation according to a combining algorithm implemented using translation statistics. If no engine succeeds in translating the sentence, the controller partitions the sentence, coordinates the engines to translates its constituent simple sentences, and combines the partial translation results into a translation result for the whole input sentence. A complex sentence is partitioned based on conjunctives and punctuation marks such as comma and semicolon. We have developed a multiple engine MT system based on the above approach. The system consists of four independent MT engines. The experiments show that the proposed approach is effective for implementing practical MT systems.",,"Algorithms; Internet; Natural language processing systems; Parallel processing systems; Multiple translation (MT) engines; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035720474

Given two translation examples, the similar parts of the sentences in the source language must correspond to the similar parts of the sentences in the target language. Similarly, the different parts must correspond to the respective parts in the translated sentences. The correspondences between similarities and between differences are learned in the form of translation templates. A translation template is a generalized translation exemplar pair where some components are generalized by replacing them with variables in both sentences and establishing bindings between these variables. The learned translation templates are obtained by replacing differences or similarities by variables. This approach has been implemented and tested on a set of sample training datasets and produced promising results for further investigation.","Corpus-based machine translation; Example-based machine translation; Exemplar based machine learning; Templates","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Knowledge based systems; Machine oriented languages; Pattern matching; Statistical methods; Analogical reasoning; Machine translation; Templates; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035397561

We present a system capable of capturing images, detecting and recognizing signs, and translating them into a target language. We describe methods for automatic sign extraction and translation. We use a user-centered approach in system development. The approach takes advantage of human intelligence if needed and leverage human capabilities.

We have developed a prototype system that can recognize Chinese sign input from a video camera that is a common gadget for a tourist, and translate the signs into English or voice stream.

The former proves economical in situations where translation among multiple languages is involved, and can be used as a knowledge-representation scheme. But given a particular interlingua, its adoption depends on its ability (a) to capture the knowledge in texts precisely and accurately and (b) to handle cross-language divergences. This paper studies the language divergence between English and Hindi and its implication to machine translation between these languages using the Universal Networking Language (UNL). UNL has been introduced by the United Nations University, Tokyo, to facilitate the transfer and exchange of information over the internet. The representation works at the level of single sentences and defines a semantic net-like structure in which nodes are word concepts and arcs are semantic relations between these concepts. The language divergences between Hindi, an Indo-European language, and English can be considered as representing the divergences between the SOV and SVO classes of languages. The work presented here is the only one to our knowledge that describes language divergence phenomena in the framework of computational linguistics through a South Asian language.","Analysis; Generation; Hindi; Interlingua; Language divergence; Universal Networking Language","Computational linguistics; Glossaries; Research; Semantics; Syntactics; Generation; Hindi; Interlingua; Language divergence; Universal networking language (UNL); Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242330469

Rewriting of headlines makes it possible to generate better translations which would not otherwise be generated, with little or no changes to the existing parts of the system. Focusing on the absence of a form of the verb be as a missing part of normal English, we have described rewriting rules for putting properly the verb be into headlines, based on information obtained by morpho-lexical and rough syntactic analysis. We have incorporated the proposed method into our English-Japanese MT system, and carried out an experiment with 312 headlines as unknown data.

Building a comprehensive lexicon, i.e., one with a high lexical coverage, is a major activity in the process of developing a good MT system. As such, the evaluation of the lexicon of an MT system is clearly a pivotal issue for the process of evaluating MT systems. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology that was devised to enable developers and users of MT Systems to evaluate their lexicons semi-automatically. This new methodology is based on the idea of the importance of a specific word or, more precisely, word sense, to a given application domain. This importance, or weight, determines how the presence of such a word in, or its absence from, the lexicon affects the MT system's lexical quality, which in turn will naturally affect the overall output quality. The method, which adopts a black-box approach to evaluation, was implemented and applied to evaluating the lexicons of three commercial English-Arabic MT systems. A specific domain was chosen in which the various word-sense weights were determined by feeding sample texts from the domain into a system developed specifically for that purpose. Once this database of word senses and weights was built, test suites were presented to each of the MT systems under evaluation and their output rated by a human operator as either correct or incorrect. Based on this rating, an overall automated evaluation of the lexicons of the systems was deduced.","Arabic; Coverage; Evaluation; Lexicons; Translation quality","Calculations; Computational linguistics; Computer software; Database systems; Natural language processing systems; Random processes; Statistical methods; Lexicon; Machine translation system; Translation quality; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035728742

An analysis of Rosetta, concentrating on the different levels of discussion and of underlying assumptions, shows that the choice of knowledge from linguistic theories or information theory and corpora is by itself not a decisive issue. More important is the question of how the problem to be solved by an MT system is defined. An analysis of the decisions underlying Verbmobil, resulting in a list corresponding point by point to the one for Rosetta, shows how far-reaching the new approach to defining the problem of MT is. As it is shown that these systems are representative of the work in MT as it was done ten years ago and today, it can reasonably be argued that a revolution in MT has taken place, though not in exactly the way it is often believed.","Evaluation criteria; Linguistic vs. probabilistic approaches; MT as applied science; Paradigms; Rosetta; Scientific revolution; Verbmobil","Decision making; Information theory; Probability; Problem solving; Statistical methods; Evaluation criteria; Machine translation; Rosetta; Scientific revolution; Verbmobil; Computational linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035702201

The translation divergence problem is usually reserved for Transfer and Interlingual MT because it requires a large combination of complex lexical and structural mappings. A major requirement of these approaches is the accessibility of large amounts of explicit symmetric knowledge for both source and target languages. This limitation renders Transfer and Interlingual approaches ineffective in the face of structurally-divergent language pairs with asymmetric resources. GHMT addresses the more common form of this problem, source-poor/targetrich, by fully exploiting symbolic and statistical target-language resources. This non-interlingual non-transfer approach is accomplished by using target-language lexical semantics, categorial variations and subcategorization frames to overgenerate multiple lexico-structural variations from a target-glossed syntactic dependency of the source-language sentence. The symbolic overgeneration, which accounts for different possible translation divergences, is constrained by a statistical target-language model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",,"Computer aided language translation; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Divergence problems; Hybrid machine translation; Lexical semantics; Structural mapping; Structural variations; Subcategorization; Symbolic techniques; Syntactic dependencies; Computational linguistics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955618381

We propose an example-based machine translation system which uses a ‘phrasal lexicon’ in addition to the aligned sentences in its database. These phrases are extracted from the Penn Treebank using the Marker Hypothesis as a constraint on segmentation. They are then translated by three on-line machine translation (MT) systems, and a number of linguistic resources are automatically constructed which are used in the translation of new input. We perform two experiments on testsets of sentences and noun phrases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. In so doing, we obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the selected on-line MT systems. Finally, like many example-based machine translation systems, our approach also suffers from the problem of ‘boundary friction’.

Each pattern part, according to the degree of generality, contains lexical or semantic information for the arguments or adjuncts of each verb meaning. In this approach, accurate analysis can directly lead to natural and correct generation.

Such effort is prohibitively expensive for languages outside the (largely) European family. The possibility of building such resources automatically by accessing electronic corpora of such languages are therefore of great interest to those involved in studying these’new’ -‘lesser known’ languages. The main stumbling block to applying these data driven techniques directly is that most of them require large corpora rarely available for such’new’ languages. This paper describes an attempt at setting up a bootstrapping agenda to exploit the scarce corpus resources that may be available at the outset to a researcher concerned with such languages.

For the user-assisted query translation condition, participants were provided two types of cues about the meaning of each translation: a list of other terms with the same translation (potential synonyms), and a sentence in which the word was used in a translation-appropriate context. Four searchers performed the official iCLEF task, the other eight searched a smaller collection.

To insert the interface, an algorithm model described in C is translated into another source code that includes the communication with hardware components in the target system to be validated with the algorithm model. The communication between the algorithm model and hardware components is achieved using transactors that perform transformation between access operations and bus cycle transactions. I/O terminal is introduced as an interface model to relate the transactions to access operations during the execution of the algorithm model, i. e., accesses to I/O terminals invoke bus cycle transactions in hardware and vice versa. An automatic interface insertion tool is developed using the source-to-source translation to identify the I/O terminals and insert interface function calls in the source code. The proposed automatic interface insertion scheme is validated by emulating several multimedia algorithms written in C on real target systems.","Automatic interface insertion; In-system verification; Source-to-source translation","Algorithms; C (programming language); Input output programs; Interfaces (computer); Mathematical models; Algorithm models; Automatic interface insertion; In-system verification; Source-to-source translation; Systems analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037004701

The former can be obtained by converting valency information and case frames from previously-built electronic dictionaries used in machine translation. The latter can be acquired from concept co-occurrence information, which is extracted automatically from a corpus.

The first classification enables evaluators to define an intended context of use, while the links to the second classification generate a relevant quality model (quality characteristics and metrics) for the respective context. The second classification provides definitions of various metrics used by the community. Further on, as part of ongoing, long-term research, we explain how metrics are analyzed, first from the general point of view of ""meta-evaluation"", then focusing on examples.

In the combat against international and organized crime, the European Union (EU) has supported a number of research and development projects within the domain of law enforcement focusing on cross-border communication, information extraction and data analysis in a multilingual context as well as terminology and knowledge management. LinguaNet is a case in point and the only project involving a multilingual messaging system. A high level of user involvement was a prominent feature of the project and the resulting software - the LinguaNet system - has gained widespread recognition and usage. The paper gives an overview of the LinguaNet approach as a whole emphasising the temporary experimental embedding of fully automatic MT in a multilingual messaging system. The system is intended for use by professionals with no background in linguistics but in great need of fast and robust communication. One of the conclusions drawn from this experiment is that authoring errors proved to be much more counter-productive than insufficiencies of MT. Another conclusion is that it is preferable to leave it to the recipient of a message to request a machine translation rather than providing it automatically up front. In more general terms, the police liked the approach and reported the need for more message type templates and MT facilities. Finally, the project lead to the formation of a European LinguaNet user group network.","Controlled-content data elements; Embedded machine translation; Multilingual casualty registration; Multilingual knowledge databases; Multilingual term bases; Police communication","Computer software; Data reduction; Database systems; Embedded systems; Graphical user interfaces; Information retrieval; Interoperability; Law enforcement; Linguistics; XML; Controlled content data elements; Cross border messaging systems; Embedded machine translation; Multilingual casualty registration; Multilingual knowledge databases; Multilingual term bases; Police communication; Software package LinguaNet; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744229190

A crucial problem in such rule-based machine translation is how to acquiring the translation knowledge, or called translation rules. Many studies have been conducted for automatic acquisition in the past, but they require a great deal of annotated examples. However, it is difficult to get a large number of the annotated examples. At fact, most bilingual texts are not matched in sentences, although matched as the whole text. In this paper, we describe a semi-automatic process of acquisition machine translation knowledge from Japanese-Chinese parallel corpora. The process consists of the following three parts. The first part is ""Parallel Text Alignment"", PTA for short. The second part is ""Example Analysis and Annotation"", EAA for short. And the third part is ""Construction of the Translation Rules"", CTR for short. The process interacts with a linguist in order to solve problems that the system is unable to solve. This approach is more efficient than the completely automatic approach in the sense that fewer examples are required. In this paper, we describe the basic idea and the methods of PTA, EAA, and CTR. A prototype system based on the proposed method has been built and some experiments on Japanese-Chinese have been carried. The results show that once the acquired knowledge is integrated with an MT system, we observe a significant improvement in translation quality.","Machinr Translation; Parallel Text Alignmen; Translation Knowledge","Knowledge acquisition; Linguistics; Logic programming; Problem solving; Machine translation; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038345956

Given a system consisting of two translation functions (one from language A to language B and one from B to A), training text is translated from A to B and back again to A. Using these two translations, differences in knowledge between the two translation functions are identified, and rules are learned to improve the functions. Context-independent rules are learned where the information suggests only a single possible translation for a word. When there are multiple alternate translations for a word, a likelihood ratio test is used to identify words that co-occur with each case significantly. These words are then used as context in context-dependent rules. Applied on the Pan American Health Organization corpus of 20,084 sentences, the learned rules improve the understandability of the translation produced by the SDL International engine on 78% of sentences, with high precision.",,"Context free languages; Functions; Knowledge based systems; Logic programming; Maximum likelihood estimation; Statistical methods; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Learning systems; Learning rules; Machine translation system; Precision languages; Translation engines; Context independent; Health organizations; High-precision; Likelihood ratio tests; Machine translation systems; Translation functions; Understandability; Learning systems; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444269874

Since it is vital to choose proper terms when translating legal documents, which include technical terms and unique patterns, it is desirable to compile bilingual dictionaries for each legal domain. Compiling basic bilingual dictionaries for legal documents, however, is a difficult task because of the great range of legal documents. This paper describes a method for automatically extracting translation patterns for legal document translation by using legal documents and their translated documents. The proposed method extracts translation patterns with Japanese bunsetsu-level units from legal sentences and the translated sentences that are properly aligned with each other. The proposed method utilizes three indexes for pattern extraction: bilingual dictionaries, statistical co-occurrence information on the parallel corpus, and syntactic information based on dependency grammar. We have extracted translation patterns from the Japanese Civil Code and its translation. The result has provided 80.5% precision and 49.1% recall, and the extracted translation patterns will be useful for translating legal documents and helping to construct a Japanese-English legal dictionary. © 2003 IEEE.","Bilingual corpus; Dependency structure; Dictionary; Legal document; Statistical alignment; Translation pattern","Authentication; Computational linguistics; Extraction; Glossaries; Knowledge engineering; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Bilingual corpora; Dependency structures; Legal documents; Statistical alignments; Translation patterns; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945138558

Without the need of building an initial word-to-word alignment or initially segmenting the monolingual text into phrases as other methods do, this algorithm segments the sentences into phrases and finds their alignments simultaneously. For each sentence pair, ISA builds a two-dimensional matrix to represent a sentence pair where the value of each cell corresponds to the Point-wise Mutual Information (MI) between the source and target words. Based on the similarities of MI values among cells, we identify the aligned phrase pairs. Once all the phrase pairs are found, we know both how to segment one sentence into phrases and also the alignments between the source and target sentences. We use monolingual bigram language models to estimate the joint probabilities of the identified phrase pairs. The joint probabilities are then normalized to conditional probabilities, which are used by the decoder. Despite its simplicity, this approach yields phrase-to-phrase translations with significant higher precisions than our baseline system where phrase translations are extracted from the HMM word alignment. When we combine the phrase-to-phrase translations generated by this algorithm with the baseline system, the improvement on translation quality is even larger. © 2003 IEEE.","Phrase alignment; Phrase segmentation; Statistical machine translation","Algorithms; Alignment; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Knowledge engineering; Learning algorithms; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Probability; Alignment algorithms; Bi-gram language models; Conditional probabilities; Mutual informations; Phrase segmentations; Phrase translations; Statistical machine translation; Translation quality; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945115561

In subsequent stages, the 〈source, target〉 translation pairs obtained are automatically transformed into a series of resources that render the translation process more successful. Despite the fact that the output from on-line MT systems is often faulty, we demonstrate in a number of experiments that when used to seed the memories of an EBMT system, they can in fact prove useful in generating translations of high quality in a robust fashion. In addition, we demonstrate the relative gain of EBMT in comparison to on-line systems. Second, despite the perception that the documents available on the Web are of questionable quality, we demonstrate in contrast that such resources are extremely useful in automatically postediting translation candidates proposed by our system.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Example based machine translations; High quality; Post-editing; Rule based; Translation pair; Translation process; Treebanks; World Wide Web",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345016957

The search algorithm uses the translation model presented in Brown et al. (1993). Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling-salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reorderings between source and target language in order to achieve an efficient search algorithm. Word reordering restrictions especially useful for the translation direction German to English are presented. The restrictions are generalized, and a set of four parameters to control the word reordering is introduced, which then can easily be adopted to new translation directions. The beam search procedure has been successfully tested on the Verbmobil task (German to English, 8,000-word vocabulary) and on the Canadian Hansards task (French to English, 100,000-word vocabulary). For the medium-sized Verbmobil task, a sentence can be translated in a few seconds, only a small number of search errors occur, and there is no performance degradation as measured by the word error criterion used in this article.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Learning algorithms; Program translators; Traveling salesman problem; Beam search algorithms; Error criterion; Novel techniques; Performance degradation; Search Algorithms; Statistical machine translation; Target language; Translation models; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041877353

Numerous studies have introduced efficient algorithms for document analysis, some of these studies proposed an articulated and/or a translation stage. Also little work has been done in the English/Arabic (E/A) translation area. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a combination between the three trends (document understanding, E/A translation, and handling the output in articulated voice). This paper focuses on the realization of a bilingual articulated E/A system based on optical character recognition (OCR). The input of the proposed system will be an English or Arabic text through scanner or video camera; the output will be an articulated voice. The proposed scheme consists of two phases. The first phase consists of many processes, beginning with converting scanned document into an electronic processable form. Then in the segmentation step, the essential problem in Arabic OCR, that is, how to cope with the various shapes of the same character, is solved. A new methodology for segmenting Arabic characters is presented. At the end of this phase an efficient method of text recognition based on hybrid description (ANN, FFT) is used. In order to verify the performance of this phase, experiments with printed text were performed. The error rates were less than 0.1%. Results showed that the proposed scheme in this phase is very robust. In the second phase, a database with 3000 audio files was encapsulated to convert each word from the input text (the output of the first phase) to its correspondence. This research can help in many real-time applications such as: (immediate translation, machine reader for blind people, learning...).","ANN, FFT; DAU; Machine translation; OCR; Pattern recognition","Algorithms; Computer aided language translation; Pattern recognition; Real time systems; Scanning; Document analysis; Optical character recognition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037211243

We compare the performance of the XFER approach with two corpus-based approaches—Statistical MT (SMT) and Example-based MT (EBMT)—under the limited data scenario. The results indicate that the XFER system significantly outperforms both EBMT and SMT in this scenario. Results also indicate that automatically learned transfer rules are effective in improving translation performance, compared with a baseline wordto-word translation version of the system. XFER system performance with a limited number of manually written transfer rules is, however, still better than the current automatically inferred rules. Furthermore, a “multiengine” version of our system that combined the output of the XFER and SMT systems and optimizes translation selection outperformed both individual systems. © 2003, ACM.

Experiments in “porting” technologies to handle new natural languages have revealed a great potential for multilingual computing, but also a frustrating lack of linguistic resources for most languages. Recent efforts to address the lack of available resources have focused either on intensive resource development for a small number of languages or development of technologies for rapid porting. The Linguistic Data Consortium recently participated in an experiment falling primarily under the first approach, the surprise language exercise. This article describes linguistic resource creation within this context, including the overall methodology for surveying and collecting language resources, as well as details of the resources developed during the exercise. The article concludes with discussion of a new approach to solving the problem of limited linguistic resources, one that has recently proven effective in identifying core linguistic resources for less common studied languages. © 2003, ACM.

The user inserts directives in the form of comments into existing Fortran code. SMS translates the code and directives into a parallel version that runs efficiently on shared and distributed memory high-performance computing platforms including the SGI Origin, IBM SP2, Cray T3E, Sun, and Alpha and Intel clusters. Twenty directives are available to support operations including array re-declarations, inter-process communications, loop translations, and parallel I/O operations. SMS also provides tools to support incremental parallelization and debugging that significantly reduces code parallelization time from months to weeks of effort. SMS is intended for applications using regular structured grids that are solved using finite difference approximation or spectral methods. It has been used to parallelize 10 atmospheric and oceanic models, but the tool is sufficiently general that it can be applied to other structured grids codes. Recent performance comparisons demonstrate that the Eta, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean model and Regional Ocean Modeling System model, parallelized using SMS, perform as well or better than their OpenMP or Message Passing Interface counterparts. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This mechanism allows the use of highly efficient finite state approaches for morphological analysis and generation, while providing the rich linguistic descriptions often used in Machine Translation systems. Using a semiring interpretation, the weight of a morphological analysis result represents the possible linguistic interpretations of an input word, while the resulting character string itself represents the lemma of the input. Long-distance phenomena and infixation can be handled in an easy and elegant manner, simultaneously providing a seamless interface to subsequent linguistic processing modules. Two extensions to the basic model are discussed: the incorporation of lexical knowledge into the finite state transducer and a transformation that renders unification-based finite state models as efficient as those employing other weight structures. The model is applied to morphological operations in a Persian-English Machine Translation system.","Feature structures; Finite state morphology; Persian; Semiring","Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Finite automata; Mathematical models; Morphology; Natural language processing systems; Feature structure; Finite state morphology; Persian; Semiring; Transducers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244356586

It presupposes that the input is in random (compressed) form and proceeds to detail a methodology for extracting the semantics from that normal form. The idea is to enumerate contextual cues and learn to associate those cues with meaning. The process is inherently fuzzy and for this reason is also inherently adaptive in nature, It is shown that the influence of context on meaning grows exponentially with the length of a word sequence. This suggests that rule-based randomization plays a key role in rendering a field-effect natural language semantic mapping tractable. An example of rule-based randomization for semantic normalization is as follows. Suppose that two commands to a robot are deemed lo be equivalent; namely, ""Grasp and pick up the glass"" and ""Hold the cup and raise it"". Their mutual normalization might then be, ""Grab container. Lift container."" Clearly, the randomization process can be effected by rules. Also, the normalized syntax makes the result of any semantic mapping process - such as detailed herein - more efficient. A natural language front-end is described, which is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. Most significantly, the effective translation of natural language semantics is shown to critically depend on an accelerated capability for learning.","Machine learning; Natural language; Randomization; Translation","Associative storage; Computational complexity; Fuzzy sets; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Random processes; Semantics; Fuzzy relaxation; Natural language front-end; Natural language semantic mapping; Rule-based randomization; Semantic randomization; Syntactic randomization; Natural language processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242721891

Emphasis is laid on two classes of problems: 1) adequacy of linguistic description of the working languages of the MT system and 2) means of resolving lexical and syntactic ambiguity of the source text. It is claimed that no parser, however sophisticated or advanced, can be made entirely free of lacunae and gaps. The reason is that many of the linguistic facts, including those critical for parser operation, have never come into view of researchers simply because they have not had at their disposal mass material of unexpected or incorrect parsing. It is exactly such material that is amply provided by a highly developed NLP system. If handled properly, this feedback helps the researcher to find the gaps of scientific descriptions and eliminate them.

The 'hata' (= to do) verb, which is frequently used in Korean, can be syntactically realized with two different forms representing, however, the same prepositional meaning: 'X-hata' (= to do X) and 'X-lul hata' (= to do X). Based on this observation, we propose two verb constructions share the verb patterns, in other words, they share the subcategorization frames. This kind of sharing of information can eliminate the redundancy of verb patterns and increase the coverage of 'X-hata' patterns. However, it could pose a generation problem, since a verb pattern contains not only a source language pattern part for the analysis but also a corresponding target language pattern part for the generation. To solve this, we classify 'X-lul hata' construction according to its corresponding Chinese expression, and propose the generation process be tailored for each type. The evaluation of the proposed method shows 90.6% success rate.","'Hata' Verb; Korean-Chinese Machine Translation; Light-verb construction; Support Verb; Verb Pattern","Computer aided language translation; Data acquisition; Functions; Linguistics; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Problem solving; Semantics; Syntactics; Korean Chinese machine translation; Light verb construction; Support verbs; Verb patterns; Information retrieval",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442277834

Such methods extract bilingual collocations from sentence pairs of source and target language sentences. Then those collocations are registered in an MT bilingual dictionary. Bilingual collocations are lexically corresponding pairs of parts extracted from sentence pairs. This paper describes a new method for automatic extraction of bilingual collocations from a parallel text corpus using no linguistic knowledge. We use Recursive Chain-link-type Learning (RCL), which is a learning algorithm, to extract bilingual collocations. Our method offers two main advantages. One benefit is that this RCL system requires no linguistic knowledge. The other advantage is that it can extract many bilingual collocations, even if the frequency of appearance of the bilingual collocations is very low. Experimental results verify that our system extracts bilingual collocations efficiently.

Using the CLEF 2001 and CLEF 2002 topics and document collections, this paper evaluates these techniques within the context of a monolingual document ranking formula based upon logistic regression. Each individual technique yields improved performance over runs which do not utilize that technique. Moreover the techniques are complementary, in that combining the best techniques outperforms individual technique performance. An approximate but fast document translation using bilingual wordlists created from machine translation systems is presented and evaluated.

In interactive applications, that task involves at least two steps: (1) the machine locates promising documents in a collection that is larger than the searcher could scan, and (2) the searcher recognizes documents relevant to their intended use from among those nominated by the machine. This article presents the results of experiments designed to explore three techniques for supporting interactive relevance assessment: (1) full machine translation, (2) rapid term-by-term translation, and (3) focused phrase translation. Machine translation was found to better support this task than term-by-term translation, and focused phrase translation further improved recall without an adverse effect on precision. The article concludes with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation framework used in this study and some remarks on implications of these results for future evaluation campaigns.","Cross-language information retrieval; Evaluation of information retrieval systems; Interactive information retrieval; Machine translation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843061232

The users of controlled languages are of two types, firstly the authors of documents written in the controlled language and secondly the end-user readers of the documents. As a subset of natural language, controlled language restricts vocabulary, grammar, and style for the purpose of reducing or eliminating both ambiguity and complexity. The use of controlled language can help decrease the complexity of natural language to a certain degree and thus improve the translation quality, especially for the partial or total automatic translation of non-general purpose texts, such as technical documents, manuals, instructions and medical reports. Our focus is on the machine translation of medical protocols applied in the field of zoonosis.

In particular, existing statistical systems for machine translation often treat different inflected forms of the same lemma as if they were independent of one another. The bilingual training data can be better exploited by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related inflected forms. We propose the construction of hierarchical lexicon models on the basis of equivalence classes of words. In addition, we introduce sentence-level restructuring transformations which aim at the assimilation of word order in related sentences. We have systematically investigated the amount of bilingual training data required to maintain an acceptable quality of machine translation. The combination of the suggested methods for improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources has been successfully tested: We were able to reduce the amount of bilingual training data to less than 10% of the original corpus, while losing only 1.6% in translation quality.

Typically, a partial hypothesis is composed by a subset of source positions, which indicates the words that have been translated in this hypothesis, and a prefix of the target sentence. Thus, the target sentence is generated from left to right obtaining source words in an arbitrary order. We present a new approach, where the source sentence is translated from left to right and the possible word reordering is performed at the target prefix.

The edit kernels are simple and have significant biological and probabilistic interpretations. Second, we convert the region of an input mRNA sequence downstream to a putative TIS into an amino acid sequence before applying SVMs to avoid the high redundancy in the genetic code. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on previously published data.

A technique for inferring finite-state transducers is proposed in this article. This technique is based on formal relations between finite-state transducers and rational grammars. Given a training corpus of source-target pairs of sentences, the proposed approach uses statistical alignment methods to produce a set of conventional strings from which a stochastic rational grammar (e.g., an n-gram) is inferred.

The model is described using a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source-channel approach.

Two complementary methods are used to analyze its sensitivity to its dimensional and angular variations. First, a linkage kinematic analysis method is used to have a rough idea of the influence of the dimensional variations on the location of the end-effector, and shows that the variations in design parameters of the same type from one leg to another one have the same influence on the end-effector. However, this method does not allow the designer to know the influence of the variations in the parallelograms. Thus, a differential vector method is used to study the influence of the dimensional and angular variations in the parts of the manipulator, and particularly the variations in the parallelograms, on the position and orientation of the end-effector. It turns out that the isotropic kinematic configuration of the manipulator is the least sensitive one to its geometrical variations, contrary to the closest configurations to its kinematic singular configurations, which are the most sensitive to geometrical variations.","Kinematic Analysis; Kinematic Singularity; Parallel Kinematic Machine; Sensitivity Analysis","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Joints (structural components); Kinematics; Manipulators; Natural frequencies; Sensitivity analysis; Vectors; Kinematic Analysis; Kinematic Singularity; Orthoglides; Parallel Kinematic Machine; Machine components",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13944254033

However, it is difficult to give complete linguistic knowledge to the system ex ante because natural language has various linguistic phenomena. Therefore, we worked to develop learning-based machine translation. In learning-based machine translation, a system acquires translation rules automatically from translation examples that are pairs of source and target language sentences. However, existing learning-based machine translation presents the problem that it requires a large number of similar translation examples. Consequently, it cannot acquire enough useful translation rules from sparse translation examples. This paper proposes a method of machine translation using Recursive Chain-Link-type Learning, which can acquire many useful translation rules from sparse translation examples. Our system, based on this method, efficiently acquires translation rules from each translation example without requiring two similar translation examples. Translation rules are acquired by extracting corresponding parts between source and target language sentences in translation examples. Our system determines those corresponding parts using previously acquired translation rules. Therefore, the system engenders a chain reaction in acquisition of new translation rules.

The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to a set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. Unfortunately, examining more of the space leads to unacceptably slow decodings. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast but non-optimal greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, FPGA-based accelerator is limited to synthesizable design. To apply hardware acceleration to behavioral testbench, the proposed method automatically translates testbench into equivalent hardware by emulating the standard simulation reference model. By mapping testbench into hardware accelerator to be merged with the design under verification, we can accelerate behavioral testbench and remove the communication overhead between the software simulator and hardware accelerator. Our experiments demonstrated that the simulation time is reduced by a factor of about 1000 as compared to the conventional hardware accelerated simulation. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Behavioral testbench; Communication overheads; Fully accelerated simulations; Hardware accelerators; Automation; Computational complexity; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Field programmable gate arrays; Mathematical models; Translation (languages); Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244399806

The decisions are worked out on the basis of projecting the functional values through the traditional categorial meanings of language units and structures. The syntactic polysemy is understood as the immediate realization of more than one categorial head meaning within the same language structure.

However, the presence of exception handlers complicates the job of the just-in-time (JIT) compiler, while exceptions are rarely used in most programs. This paper describes two techniques for reducing such complications. First, we delay the translation of an exception handler until the exception really occurs. This on-demand translation of exception handlers allows more optimizations when translating the main flow, without being hindered by constraints caused by the exception flows. Secondly, for those exceptions that are actually thrown during program execution we insert exception-type check code and a direct branch to the translated exception handlers. This exception handler prediction is motivated by an observation that frequently thrown exceptions are likely to be handled by the same exception handlers, so this will eliminate the exception processing overhead of the Java virtual machine. Our experiments indicate that the code quality of the main flow is no longer affected by the presence of exception handlers. Also, frequently thrown exceptions can be efficiently handled by the exception handler prediction.

Major barriers to building a high-performing word sense disambiguation system include the difficulty of labeling data for this task and of predicting fine-grained sense distinctions. These issues stem partly from the fact that the task is being treated in isolation from possible uses of automatically disambiguated data. In this paper, we consider the related task of word translation, where we wish to determine the correct translation of a word from context. We can use parallel language corpora as a large supply of partially labeled data for this task. We present algorithms for solving the word translation problem and demonstrate a significant improvement over a baseline system. We then show that the word-translation system can be used to improve performance on a simplified machinetranslation task and can effectively and accurately prune the set of candidate translations for a word. © 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Translation (languages); Baseline systems; Contextual feature; Improve performance; Machine translations; Parallel languages; Word Sense Disambiguation; Word sense disambiguation systems; Word translation; Natural language processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053276811

Unlike other synchronous grammars, CSG allows multiple target productions to be associated to a single source production rule, which can be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in the pattern. Furthermore, CSG is augmented with independent rewriting that allows expressing discontinuous constituents in the inference rules. It turns out that such grammar is more expressive to model the translational equivalences of parallel texts for machine translation, and in this paper, we propose the use of CSG as a basis for building a machine translation (MT) system for Portuguese to Chinese translation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Constraint theory; Mathematical models; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Syntactics; Word processing; Constraint-based Synchronous Grammar (CSG); Synchronous grammar; Translational equivalences; Context free grammars",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645957911

We propose two new algorithms for the transfer of fertility parameters from Model 2 to Model 3. Our algorithms have a worst case time complexity of O(m3) improving on the exponential time algorithm proposed in the classical paper on IBM Models. When the maximum fertility of a word is small, our algorithms are O(m 2) and hence very efficient in practice. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Mathematical models; Natural language processing systems; English-Hindi statistical machine translation system; IBM Models; Statistical machine translation system; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26444570853

Our CLIR system uses a simple probabilistic language model; the studies used TREC test corpora over Chinese, Spanish and Arabic. Our findings include: One can achieve an acceptable CLIR performance using only a bilingual term list (70-80% on Chinese and Arabic corpora). However, if a bilingual term list and parallel corpora are available, CLIR performance can rival monolingual performance. If no parallel corpus is available, pseudo-parallel texts produced by an MT system can partially overcome the lack of parallel text. While stemming is useful normally, with a very large parallel corpus for Arabic-English, stemming hurt performance in our empirical studies with Arabic, a highly inflected language. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Gough and Way in MT Summit pp. 133-140 (2003) focused on controlling the output text in a novel manner, while Gough and Way (9th Workshop of the EAMT, (2004a), pp. 73-81) sought to constrain the input strings according to controlled language specifications. Our original sub-sentential alignment algorithm could deal only with 1:1 matches, but subsequent refinements enabled n:m alignments to be captured. A direct consequence was that we were able to populate the system's databases with more than six times as many potentially useful fragments. Together with two simple novel improvements - correcting a small number of mistranslations in the lexicon, and allowing multiple translations in the lexicon - translation quality improves considerably. We provide detailed automatic and human evaluations of a number of experiments carried out to test the quality of the system. We observe that our system outperforms the rule-based on-line system Logomedia on a range of automatic evaluation metrics, and that the 'best' translation candidate is consistently highly ranked by our system. Finally, we note in a number of tests that the BLEU metric gives objectively different results than other automatic evaluation metrics and a manual evaluation.

However, tagged corpora contain errors, which impedes the progress of research. Therefore, the correction of errors in corpora is an important research issue. In this study we investigate the correction of such errors, which we call corpus correction. Using machine-learning methods, we applied corpus correction to a verb modality corpus for machine translation. We used the maximum-entropy and decision-list methods as machine-learning methods. We compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments, and determined which is most effective by using a statistical test. We obtained several noteworthy findings: (1) Precision was almost the same for both detection and correction, so it is more convenient to do both correction and detection, rather than detection only. (2) In general, the maximum-entropy method worked better than the decision-list method; but the two methods had almost the same precision for the top 50 pieces of extracted data when closed data was used. (3) In terms of precision, the use of closed data was better than the use of open data; however, in terms of the total number of extracted errors, the use of open data was better than the use of closed data. Based on our analysis of these results, we developed a good method for corpus correction. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by carrying out experiments on machine translation. As corpus-based machine translation continues to be developed, the corpus correction we discuss in this article should prove to be increasingly significant. © 2005 ACM.","Corpus correction; Machine learning; Machine translation; Modality corpus","Corpus correction; Machine translation; Maximum-entropy methods; Modality corpus; Algorithms; Error detection; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Statistical methods; Translation (languages); Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844440317

New techniques to guarantee correctness do not verify the compiler itself, but check for each compiled program whether it is correctly translated. Following these ideas, we developed an approach in which checking is realized as proof checking within a formal specification and verification framework. Based on formal specifications of source and target language and a translation predicate, compilers produce, in addition to the target program c, a proof that c is correct w.r.t. its source program. This proof can be checked independently of the compiler by the framework. Thus, it can be used as a translation certificate. The paper describes the overall approach and applies it to a simple translation scenario. Specification and verification is done within the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.

Unlike other disambiguation approaches, using corpora for handling the problem, which use the Most Likelihood Model in their statistical works, this article proposes the Random Numbers Model. We believe that this model is more reasonable from the scientific point of view and find that it offers the most precise and accurate results. This method has been tested for a selected set of English texts containing multiple-meaning words with respect to Persian language and the results are encouraging. © The Author.

In this paper, we present a new algorithm to recognize TISs with a very high accuracy. Our algorithm includes two novel ideas. First, we introduce a class of new sequence-similarity kernels based on string editing, called edit kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to predict TISs. The edit kernels are simple and have significant biological and probabilistic interpretations. Although the edit kernels are not positive definite, it is easy to make the kernel matrix positive definite by adjusting the parameters. Second, we convert the region of an input mRNA sequence downstream to a putative TIS into an amino acid sequence before applying SVMs to avoid the high redundancy in the genetic code. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on previously published data. Our experimental results on real mRNA data show that both ideas improve the prediction accuracy greatly and that our method performs significantly better than those based on neural networks and SVMs with polynomial kernels or Salzberg kernels. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Edit distance; mRNA; Support vector machine; Translation initiation site","messenger RNA; accuracy; algorithm; amino acid sequence; artificial neural network; biology; conference paper; eukaryote; genetic code; mathematical analysis; prediction; priority journal; probability; RNA sequence; sequence homology; support vector machine; translation initiation; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Codon, Initiator; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Eukaryotic Cells; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Eukaryota",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844478874

While it is perhaps unsurprising that system performance is correlated with the amount of training data, we address in this paper the question of whether a large-scale, robust EBMT system such as ours can outperform a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system. We obtained a large English-French translation memory from Sun Microsystems from which we randomly extracted a near 4K test set. The remaining data was split into three training sets, of roughly 50K, 100K and 200K sentence-pairs in order to measure the effect of increasing the size of the training data on the performance of the two systems. Our main observation is that contrary to perceived wisdom in the field, there appears to be little substance to the claim that SMT systems are guaranteed to outperform EBMT systems when confronted with 'enough' training data. Our tests on a 4.8 million word bitext indicate that while SMT appears to outperform our system for French-English on a number of metrics, for English-French, on all but one automatic evaluation metric, the performance of our EBMT system is superior to the baseline SMT model. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",,"Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Mathematical models; Statistical methods; Text processing; Example based machine translation (EBMT); Statistical machine translation (SMT); Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25844441555

However, these models are usually context-independent, therefore, the disambiguation of the translation of a source word must be carried out using other probabilistic distributions (distortion distributions and statistical language models). One efficient way to add contextual information to the statistical lexicons is based on maximum entropy modeling. In that framework, the context is introduced through feature functions that allow us to automatically learn context-dependent lexicon models. In a first approach, maximum entropy modeling is carried out after a process of learning standard statistical models (alignment and lexicon). In a second approach, the maximum entropy modeling is integrated in the expectation- maximization process of learning standard statistical models. Experimental results were obtained for two well-known tasks, the French-English Canadian Parliament Hansards task and the German-English Verbmobil task. These results proved that the use of maximum entropy models in both approaches, can help to improve the performance of the statistical translation systems.","Context-dependent lexicon models; Maximum entropy modeling; Statistical machine translation","Entropy; Mathematical models; Probability distributions; Statistical methods; Context-dependent lexicon models; Maximum entropy modeling; Statistical machine translation; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044454058

One of these areas is machine translation, where the approaches that are based on building models automatically from training examples are becoming more and more attractive. Finite-state transducers are very adequate to be used in constrained tasks where training samples of pairs of sentences are available. A technique to infer finite-state transducers is proposed in this work. This technique is based on formal relations between finite-state transducers and finite-state grammars. Given a training corpus of input-output pairs of sentences, the proposed approach uses statistical alignment methods to produce a set of conventional strings from which a stochastic finite-state grammar is inferred. This grammar is finally transformed into a resulting finite-state transducer. The proposed methods are assessed through series of machine translation experiments within the framework of the EUTRANS project. © 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although output quality obviously plays a major role, it is not the sole decisive factor. User perception of MT, however, is an important issue, and MT needs to be seen as one of several tools in the user's work environment. Trends, such as globalisation and the high volume of multilingual information available on the internet and within large companies, have made fast and consistent translation, and thus machine translation, indispensable in accelerating decision making. However, the logistics and workflows necessary for the successful integration of MT are complex and varied. Comprendium employs a highly flexible architecture to deal with these complex customer-specific demands. It thus advances the practical use of MT by allowing a wide range of MT workflow solutions to be implemented both in the translation ""cottage industry"" and in large corporate translation portals and professional translation environments.

The goal is to produce a synthetic combination that surpasses all of the original systems in translation quality. Our approach uses the individual MT engines as ""black boxes"" and does not require any explicit cooperation from the original MT systems. An explicit word matcher is first used in order to identify the words that are common between the MT engine outputs. A decoding algorithm then uses this information, in conjunction with confidence estimates for the various engines and a trigram language model in order to score and rank a collection of sentence hypotheses that are synthetic combinations of words from the various original engines. The highest scoring sentence hypothesis is selected as the final output of our system. Experiments conducted using three Chinese-to-English online translation systems demonstrate that our multi-engine combination system provides an improvement of about 6% over the best original system, and is about equal in translation quality to an ""oracle"" capable of selecting the best of the original systems on a sentence-by-sentence basis.

Non-grammatical sentences are often produced by automatic systems and there is even no guarantee that the meaning of the sentence is preserved. Nevertheless, automatic translation systems can be used to help human translators to produce high-quality translations. This is the goal of the TransType2 project, where an interactive translation tool is being developed that suggests, in real time, possible completions for the sentences that the human translator is typing. This leads to a modification of the generation strategy of the translation system, as now we are looking for the best translation of the given source sentence that is compatible with the prefix. In order to remain within the tight response time constraints of such a system, some simplifications have to be done. In this paper, we review possible generation strategies for an interactive statistical machine translation system and analyze what is the loss in performance when strict time constraints have to be met. Experiments are performed on the Spanish-English and German-English Xerox corpora, which consist of the translation of technical manuals, and the results show that the real time generation strategy causes only a small performance degradation.",,"Automatic systems; Automatic translation; High quality; Machine translations; Performance degradation; Real time; Response-time constraint; Statistical machine translation system; Technical manuals; Time constraints; Translation systems; Translation tools; Technical writing; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449123709

System theory investigates the role of the parts, their interaction and the relation of the whole with its environment. System theory of the second order examines how an observer relates to the system. This paper traces some of the recent discussion of example-based machine translation (EBMT) and compares a number of EBMT and statistical MT systems. It is found that translation examples are linguistic systems themselves that consist of words, phrases and other constituents. Two properties of Luhmann's (2002) system theory are discussed in this context: EBMT has focussed on the properties of structures suited for translation and the design of their reentry points, and SMT develops connectivity operators which select the most likely continuations of structures. While technically the SMT and EBMT approaches complement each other, the principal distinguishing characteristic results from different sets of values which SMT and EBMT followers prefer. © Springer Science+Business Media 2007.","Emergent behaviour; Example-based machine translation; Statistical EBMT; Statistical machine translation; System theory","Linguistics; Mathematical operators; Set theory; Statistical methods; Translation (languages); Emergent behaviour; Example-based machine translation; Statistical EBMT; Statistical machine translation; System theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847320675

In previous work, we demonstrated that while an EBMT system is capable of outperforming a phrase-based SMT (PBSMT) system constructed from freely available resources, a hybrid 'example-based' SMT system incorporating marker chunks and SMT subsentential alignments is capable of outperforming both baseline translation models for French-English translation. In this paper, we show that similar gains are to be had from constructing a hybrid 'statistical' EBMT system. Unlike the previous research, here we use the Europarl training and test sets, which are fast becoming the standard data in the field. On these data sets, while all hybrid 'statistical' EBMT variants still fall short of the quality achieved by the baseline PBSMT system, we show that adding the marker chunks to create a hybrid 'example-based' SMT system outperforms the two baseline systems from which it is derived. Furthermore, we provide further evidence in favour of hybrid systems by adding an SMT target-language model to the EBMT system, and demonstrate that this too has a positive effect on translation quality. We also show that many of the subsentential alignments derived from the Europarl corpus are created by either the PBSMT or the EBMT system, but not by both. In sum, therefore, despite the obvious convergence of the two paradigms, the crucial differences between SMT and EBMT contribute positively to the overall translation quality. The central thesis of this paper is that any researcher who continues to develop an MT system using either of these approaches will benefit further from integrating the advantages of the other model; dogged adherence to one approach will lead to inferior systems being developed. © Springer Science+Business Media 2007.","Chunk coverage; Convergence; Europarl corpus; Example-based MT; Hybrid; Statistical language models; Statistical MT","Convergence of numerical methods; Formal languages; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Statistical methods; Chunk coverage; Europarl corpus; Example-based MT; Hybrid; Statistical language models; Statistical MT; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847255471

In order to eliminate loss of immersion due to teleoperation delays, in our third generation system we are eliminating one class of teleoperated mechanical motion by allowing rotations to take place at the user's location instead of at the remote location.

It proposes the translation algorithm as a specification interface to well-established automata-theoretic control synthesis methods for discrete-event systems (DES's). This allows control requirements to be more easily described and understood in an expressive and readable language that temporal logic is widely recognized as. Adding such a translation interface effectively combines specifiability and readability in temporal logic with prescriptiveness and computability in automata. The former temporal logic features support specification while the latter automata features support the prescription of DES dynamics and algorithmic computations. A practical implementation of the interface has been developed, providing an enabling technology for writing more readable control specifications in PTL that it translates for finitary control synthesis in automata. A simple example illustrates the use of the proposed temporal logic interface. Practical implications of the complexity of the translation algorithm are discussed. © 2005 IEEE.","Automatic translation; Discrete-event systems; Finite automata; Prepositional linear time temporal logic; Supervisory control","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Control system analysis; Formal logic; Interfaces (computer); Automatic translation; Discrete event systems (DES's); Prepositional linear time temporal logic (PTL); Automata theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846150692

Using this model, we translate monotonically taking a permutation graph as input. The permutation graph is constrained using an efficient and flexible reordering framework. We then propose to automatically identify source word sequences which should always be translated monotonically and keep the word order of these sequences in search. This allows us to obtain fast good-quality translations.

A novel decoding algorithm is directly derived from the optimization criterion which defines the statisticalMT approach. Efficiency in decoding is achieved by applying dynamic programming, pruning strategies, and word reordering constraints. It is known that translation performance can be boosted by exploiting phrase (or multiword) translation pairs automatically extracted from a parallel corpus. New phrase-based models are obtained by introducing extra multiwords in the target language vocabulary and by estimating the corresponding parameters from either: (i) a word-based model, (ii) phrase-based statistics computed on the parallel corpus, or (iii) the interpolation of the two previous estimates. Word-based and phrase-based MT models are evaluated on a traveling domain task in two translation directions: Chinese-English (12k-word vocabulary) and Italian-English (16k-word vocabulary). Phrase-based models show Bleu score improvements over the word-based model by 19% and 13% relative, respectively. © 2005, ACM.

However, since the translation is done on a single bytecode basis, it is likely to generate frequent memory accesses for local variables which can be a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose to add a small register file to the datapath of the hardware-translation based JVM and use it as a local variable cache. We evaluate the effectiveness of the local variable cache against the size of the local variable cache which determines the chip area overhead and the operating speed. We also discuss the mechanisms for the efficient parameter passing and the on-the-fly profiling. With two types of exceptions, a 16-entry local variable cache achieved hit ratios of 60 to 98%. The first type of exceptions is represented by the FFT, which accesses more than 16 local variables. In this case, on-the-fly profiling was effective. The hit ratio of 16-entry cache for the FFT was increased from 44 to 83%. The second type of exception is represented by the SAXON XSLT processor for which cold misses were significant. The proposed parameter passing mechanism turned 6.4 to 13.3% of total accesses from miss to hit to the local variable cache.

To reduce the problem, a large-scale parallel corpus is required and, therefore, an efficient method is needed to retrieve translation examples from a large-scale corpus. The authors propose an efficient retrieval method for a sentence-wise EBMT using edit-distance. The proposed retrieval method efficiently retrieves the most similar sentences using the measure of edit-distance without omissions. The proposed method employs search-space division, word graphs, and an A* search algorithm.

For monolingual retrieval we have focused our work on local query expansion, i.e. using only the information from retrieved documents. External corpora, such as the Web, were not used. Our document retrieval system is simple; it is based on vector space model. Some local expansion techniques were applied for training topics. The best improvement was achieved using association thesauri, which were constructed employing co-occurrence relations in term windows, not in complete document. This technique is effective and can be easily implemented without tuning some parameters. Our mandatory runs (title+description topic fields) have obtained good positions in all monolingual subtasks we participate. For bilingual retrieval two machine translation programs were used to translate the topics from Italian into Spanish. Both translations were joined before searching. The same expansion technique was also applied. Our mandatory run has got the top rank in the bilingual subtask.

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using a mono-lingual QA system for English, and translating answers and finding appropriate documents in Italian and Dutch. For factoid and definition questions, we achieve overall accuracy scores ranging from 13% (EN→NL) to 17% (EN→IT) and lenient accuracy figures from 19% (EN→NL) to 25% (EN→IT). The advantage of this strategy to cross-lingual QA is that translation of answers is easier than translating questions-the disadvantage is that answers might be missing from the source corpus and additional effort is required for finding supporting documents of the target language.","Machine translation; Natural language processing; Question answering","Computational linguistics; Digital libraries; Natural language processing systems; Cross-lingual question answering; Definition questions; Machine translations; NAtural language processing; Overall accuracies; Question Answering; Source language; Target language; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922032113

The SINAI research group participated in both the ad hoc task and the medical task. The experiments accomplished in both tasks result from very different approaches. For the adhoc task the main IR system used is the same as that of the 2005 ImageCLEF adhoc task. The improvement of the adhoc system is a new Machine Translation system that works with several translators and implements several heuristics. We have participated in the English monolingual task and in six bilingual tasks for the languages: Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The results obtained shown that the English monolingual results are good (0,2234 is our best result) and there is a loss of precision with the bilingual runs and some languages like German or Spanish works better than others, because of the translations. For the medical task, this year we carried out new and very different experiments to imageCLEFmed2005 ones. First of all, we have processed the set of collections using Information Gain (IG) to determine which are the best tags that should be considered in the indexing process. These tags are those supposed to provide the most relevant and non-redundant information, and have been selected automatically according to our information-based strategy along with the data and relevance assessments from last year. This year, our goal was to analyze how tag selection may contribute to the quality of final results. In order to select reduced set of tags we have computed IG. 11 different collections were generated according to the percentage of tags with highest IG value. Finally, only results related to experiments with selections over the 20%, 30% and 40% of available tags were submitted, since they reported best performance on 2005 data. Experiments using only textual query and using textual mixing with visual query have been submitted. For visual query we have used the GIFT lists provide by the organization. Surprisingly, the system performs better on the text retrieval alone than mixed textual and visual retrieval. On the other hand, we try show that information filtering through tag selection using information gain improves retrieval results without the need of a manual selection, but the obtained results are no conclusive. Unfortunately, the results obtained are not as successful as desired. Due to a computing processing mistake all our mixed runs obtain the same results than the visual GIFT baseline (0.0467). At the moment of writing of this paper we are modifying our system in order to solve this problem.","Indexing; Information gain; Machine translators; Visual and text retrieval","Computational linguistics; Content based retrieval; Digital libraries; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Information use; Translation (languages); Indexing process; Information gain; Information-based strategy; Machine translation systems; Monolingual tasks; Relevance assessments; Text retrieval; Visual retrieval; Information filtering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922021313

Phase 2 addresses this limitation by using information taken from English and Filipino POS Taggers. The seed rules are generated by aligning the POS tags from English and Filipino examples, including their constraints. To perform compositionality, the system deduces the constituent labels by using the longest adjacent POS tags found in both the English and Filipino rule. The system groups together similar rules and generalizes it to encompass a wider range of unseen examples.","Bilingual corpus; Compositionality; Examplebased; Machine learning; Machine translation; Natural language processing; Rule generalization; Rule generation; Rule-based","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Natural language processing systems; Bilingual corpora; Compositionality; Example-based; Machine translations; NAtural language processing; Rule based; Rule generalization; Rule generation; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863676016

This work contributes to the automated development of concurrent Java programs from such integrated specifications.

In the context of best current Java concurrent programming practice, we extend the original JCSP package to support the integrated B and CSP specification by implementing new channel classes.

However, both Intel and AMD have now introduced architectural extensions to support classical virtualization. We compare an existing software VMM with a new VMM designed for the emerging hardware support. Surprisingly, the hardware VMM often suffers lower performance than the pure software VMM. To determine why, we study architecture-level events such as page table updates, context switches and I/O, and find their costs vastly different among native, software VMM and hardware VMM execution. We find that the hardware support fails to provide an unambiguous performance advantage for two primary reasons: first, it offers no support for MMU virtualization; second, it fails to co-exist with existing software techniques for MMU virtualization. We look ahead to emerging techniques for addressing this MMU virtualization problem in the context of hardware-assisted virtualization.

Technical terms are usually multi-word terms and their meanings can be inferred from their constituents. Therefore, term constituents are essential for understanding the designated meaning of technical terms. However, there are several problems in finding the correct meanings of technical terms with their term constituents. First, because a term constituent is usually a morphological unit rather than a conceptual unit in the case of Korean technical terms, we need to first identify conceptual units by chunking term constituents. Second, conceptual units are sometimes homonyms or synonyms. Moreover their meanings show domain dependency. It is therefore necessary to give information about conceptual units and their possible meanings, including homonyms, synonyms, and domain dependency, so that natural language applications can properly handle technical terms. In this paper, we propose a term constituent alignment algorithm that extracts such information from bilingual technical term pairs. Our algorithm recognizes conceptual units and their meanings by finding English term constituents and their corresponding Korean term constituents for given English-Korean term pairs.

In particular, in statistical machine translation, heuristic search algorithms are employed whose level of approximation depends on the length of the input. Moreover, processing time can be a bottleneck with long sentences, whereas multiple text chunks can be quickly processed in parallel. Hence, in real working conditions the problem arises of how to optimally split the input text. In this work, we investigate several text segmentation criteria and verify their impact on translation performance by means of a statistical phrase-based translation system. Experiments are reported on a popular as well as difficult task, namely the translation of news agencies from Chinese-English as proposed by the NIST MT evaluation workshops.

They connect typically a noun or a pronoun to another word and show their relationships in a sentence. They are a kind of ""small"" word and can not stand alone in the sentences. However, they often pose great problems in the identification of their relationships to other constituents. Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment is especially problematic in machine translation. Besides, as prepositions by themselves are semantically very ambiguous, the translation of these words poses challenge to machine translation (MT) too. This paper discusses how some of the PP attachments and other problems concerned with PPs are resolved in an experimental English-Chinese MT system by applying controlled language technique that we have developed in the context of safety-critical applications. Examples are extracted from a small parallel bilingual corpus focused on medical protocols in English and Chinese, where the usages, in particular some of the syntactic structures, vary a lot in many aspects. It is suggested that such ambiguities can be resolved by means of lexical information, such as subcategorizations, selection constraints and other additional information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","Controlled language technique; Disambiguation; Equivalent; Grammatical functions; Machine translation (MT); Prepositional phrase attachment (PP attachment); Translation information","Classification (of information); Constraint theory; Problem solving; Semantics; Word processing; Controlled language technique; Disambiguation; Equivalent; Grammatical functions; Machine translation (MT); Prepositional phrase attachment (PP attachment); Translation information; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749666377

H3C 3J7, Canada","Lexical and syntactic mismatches between languages are the main challenge for every translation (especially formidable for Machine Translation; see Mel'čuk &amp; Wanner 2001, 2006). An example of mismatches in English-to-Russian translation: a. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and tear-gassed by the police. b. Rus. Demonstranty podverglis' zverskomu izbieniju so storony policii; protiv nix byl primenën slezotočivyj gaz lit. 'Demonstrators underwent bestial beating from_side of_police; against them was applied tear-gas'. The only way to resolve inter-linguistic mismatches is paraphrasing - intra- or interlinguistic. To explain better what I mean I will refer to mismatches found in the example. Thus, in Russian: - The verb with the meaning '[to] tear-gas' does not exist, so you have to use the semantically equivalent expression '[to] apply tear-gas'. - The passive of the verb '[to] beat' - with the Actor 'police' - does not readily combine with the noun 'police' as the syntactic Agent (it is not official enough!), so you have to use the semantically equivalent expression '[to] undergo a beating' (with the Subject 'demonstrators'). - The expression '[to] apply tear-gas' does not have a passive and therefore cannot be directly conjoined with '[to] undergo a beating' (the two clauses have different Subjects), so you have to use loose coordination of two complete clauses. Such paraphrases are described by Deep-Syntactic Paraphrasing System of the Meaning-Text Theory: a few dozens universal paraphrasing rules (Mel'čuk 1992; Milićević 2006). Paraphrasing at the semantic and/or deep-syntactic level can be ensured only by an extremely rich dictionary. Thus, the transformation '[to] tear-gas' ⇒ '[to] apply tear-gas' is triggered by the information in the lexical entry of the Russian nominal expression SLEZOTOČIVYJ GAZ 'tear-gas' (where the semi-auxiliary verb PRIMENJAT' '[to] apply' is found). Such a dictionary, semantically-based and lexical co-occurrence centered, is the Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (Mel'čuk &amp; Žolkovskyj 1984, Mel'čuk et al. 1984-1999, Mel'čuk et al. 1995). Three major zones of its lexical entry for headword L present: - L's meaning, in the form of a formalized analytical lexicographic definition equivalent to a semantic network of the Meaning-Text Theory; - L's Government Pattern, which contains complete information about L's actants and their surface realization; - L's restricted lexical cooccurrence, in the form of Lexical Functions, which supply complete information about L's collocations (for instance: Real 1(slezotočivyj gaz 'tear-gas') = primenjat'[∼ protiv 'against' NY]; [AntiBon + Magn](izbivat' '[to] beat') = zverski lit. 'bestially'; Fact2(policija 'police') = izbivat' '[to] beat', not *bit' '[to] beat', which is semantically quite plausible). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Information dissemination; Semantics; Syntactics; Translation (languages); Combinatorial dictionary; Deep-Syntactic Paraphrasing System; Machine translation; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749661425

It effects on the overall translation accuracy of machine translation systems. In this paper, we present a new approach to Korean target word selection for an English noun with translation ambiguities using multiple knowledge such as verb frame patterns, sense vectors based on collocations, statistical Korean local context information and co-occurring POS information. Verb frame patterns constructed with dictionary and corpus play an important role in resolving the sparseness problem of collocation data. Sense vectors are a set of collocation data when an English word having target selection ambiguities is to be translated to specific Korean target word. Statistical Korean Local Context Information is an N-gram information generated using Korean corpus. The co-occurring POS information is a statistically significant POS clue which appears with ambiguous word. To evaluate our approach, we applied the method to Tellus-EK* system, English-Korean automatic translation system currently developed at ETRI [1],[2].

In this method, the translation example is represented as a TSC, which is a triple consisting of a parse tree in the source language, a string in the target language, and the correspondence between the leaf node of the source-language tree and the substring of the target-language string. For an input sentence to be translated, it is first parsed into a tree. Then the TSC forest which best matches the input tree is searched for. Finally the translation is generated using a statistical generation model to combine the target-language strings of the TSCs. The generation model consists of three features: the semantic similarity between the tree in the TSC and the input tree, the translation probability of translating the source word into the target word, and the language-model probability for the target-language string. Based on the above method, we build an English-to-Chinese MT system. Experimental results indicate that the performance of our system is comparable with phrase-based statistical MT systems. © Springer Science+Business Media 2007.","Example-based machine translation; Statistical generation; Translation example; Tree-string correspondence","Mathematical models; Probability; Semantics; Statistical methods; Trees (mathematics); Example-based machine translation; Statistical generation; Translation example; Tree-string correspondence; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847253479

This is a source-channel model of translation inspired by the Alignment Template translation model. The model attempts to overcome the deficiencies of word-to-word translation models by considering phrases rather than words as units of translation. The approach we describe allows us to implement each constituent distribution of the model as a weighted finite state transducer or acceptor. We show that bitext word alignment and translation under the model can be performed with standard finite state machine operations involving these transducers. One of the benefits of using this framework is that it avoids the need to develop specialized search procedures, even for the generation of lattices or N-Best lists of bitext word alignments and translation hypotheses. We report and analyze bitext word alignment and translation performance on the Hansards French-English task and the FBIS Chinese-English task under the Alignment Error Rate, BLEU, NIST and Word Error-Rate metrics. These experiments identify the contribution of each of the model components to different aspects of alignment and translation performance.

Although these methods are applied to a particular PKM, they can be readily applied to 3-DOF Delta-Linear PKM such as ones with their linear joints parallel instead of orthogonal. On the one hand, a linkage kinematic analysis method is proposed to have a rough idea of the influence of the length variations of the manipulator on the location of its end-effector. On the other hand, a differential vector method is used to study the influence of the length and angular variations in the parts of the manipulator on the position and orientation of its end-effector. Besides, this method takes into account the variations in the parallelograms. It turns out that variations in the design parameters of the same type from one leg to another have the same effect on the position of the end-effector. Moreover, the sensitivity of its pose to geometric variations is a minimum in the kinematic isotropic configuration of the manipulator. On the contrary this sensitivity approaches its maximum close to the kinematic singular configurations of the manipulator.

This process of low-level re-engineering consists of a reverse engineering phase followed by a forward engineering phase. UQDBT, the University of Queensland Dynamic Binary Translator, is a machine-adaptable translator. Adaptability is provided through the specification of properties of machines and their instruction sets, allowing the support of different pairs of source and target machines. Most binary translators are closely bound to a pair of machines, making analyses and code hard to reuse. Like most virtual machines, UQDBT performs generic optimizations that apply to a variety of machines. Frequently executed code is translated to native code by the use of edge weight instrumentation, which makes UQDBT converge more quickly than systems based on instruction speculation. In this paper, we describe the architecture and run-time feedback optimizations performed by the UQDBT system, and provide results obtained in the x86 and SPARC® platforms.","Binary translation; Dynamic compilation; Dynamic execution; Re-engineering; Reverse engineering; Run-time profiling; Virtual machine","Computer aided language translation; Feedback; Optimization; Reverse engineering; Set theory; Binary translation; Dynamic compilation; Dynamic execution; Run-time profiling; Virtual machine; Reengineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32144432656

The level at which we assume the transfer to be carried out is the Deep-Syntactic Structure (DSyntS) as proposed in the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT). DSyntS is abstract enough to avoid all types of divergences that result either from restricted lexical co-occurrence or from surface-syntactic discrepancies between languages. As for the remaining types of syntactic divergences, all of them occur not only interlinguistically, but also intralinguistically; this means that establishing correspondences between semantically equivalent expressions of the source and target languages that diverge with respect to their syntactic structure is nothing else than paraphrasing. This allows us to adapt the powerful intralinguistic paraphrasing mechanism developed in MTT for purposes of interlinguistic transfer. © Springer Science+Business Media 2007.","Deep-syntactic structure; Meaning-text theory; Paraphrasing; Syntactic mismatch; Transfer","Linguistics; Pattern matching; Problem solving; Text processing; Sentence structures; Source languages; Syntactic mismatches; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947680633

Furthermore, while all state-of-the-art corpus-based approaches to Machine Translation (MT) rely on bitexts, this system relies on extensive target language monolingual corpora. The translation process distinguishes three phases: 1) pre-processing with 'light' rule and statistics-based NLP techniques 2) search & retrieval, 3) synthesising. At Phase 1, the source language sentence is mapped onto a lemma-to-lemma translated string. This string then forms the input to the search algorithm, which retrieves similar sentences from the corpus (Phase 2). This retrieval process is performed iteratively at increasing levels of detail, until the best match is detected. The best retrieved sentence is sent to the synthesising algorithm (Phase 3), which handles phenomena such as agreement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Algorithms; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Linguistics; Pattern matching; Lemma-to-lemma translated string; Linguistic knowledge; Machine Translation (MT); Search algorithms; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745841551

However, when a large number of translation errors get mixed into conversations, users have difficulty completely understanding each other. In this paper, we focus on misconceptions found in high volume in actual online conversations using machine translation. We first examine the response patterns in machine translation-mediated communication and associate them with misconceptions. Analysis results indicate that response messages to include misconceptions posted via machine translation tend to be incoherent, often focusing on short phrases of the original message. Next, based on the analysis results, we propose a method that automatically predicts the occurrence of misconceptions in each dialogue. The proposed method assesses the tendency of each dialogue including misconceptions by calculating the gaps between the regular discussion thread (syntactic thread) and the discussion thread based on lexical cohesion (semantic thread). Verification results show significant positive correlation between actual misconception frequency and gaps between syntactic and semantic threads, which indicate the validity of the method.

For syntactic transformation, we propose a transformational model based on a probabilistic context-free grammar.

The article reports on experiments in which support vector machines (SVMs) are employed to recognize translated text in a corpus of Italian articles from the geopolitical domain. An ensemble of SVMs reaches 86.7% accuracy with 89.3% precision and 83.3% recall on this task. A preliminary analysis of the features used by the SVMs suggests that the distribution of function words and morphosyntactic categories in general, and personal pronouns and adverbs in particular, are among the cues used by the SVMs to perform the discrimination task. A follow-up experiment shows that the performance attained by SVMs is well above the average performance of ten human subjects, including five professional translators, on the same task. Our results offer solid evidence supporting the translationese hypothesis, and our method seems to have promising applications in translation studies and in quantitative style analysis in general. Implications for the machine learning/text categorization community are equally important, both because this is a novel application and especially because we provide explicit evidence that a relatively knowledge-poor machine learning algorithm can outperform human beings in a text classification task. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750099102

The use of Machine Translation (MT) was made necessary by the vast amount of dynamic information that needed to be translated in a timely fashion.

Test results using English to Tagalog translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for selecting word translation with a standardized precision of at least 80% for generating expected translations using 200 sentences with ambiguous words (an average of 4 senses) in three categories: Nouns, verbs, and adjectives, using 145,746 word pairs in syntactic relationships, extracted from target corpora (317,113 words).","Machine translation; Word sense disambiguation","Automated approach; Bilingual dictionary; Machine translations; Multiple targets; Word Sense Disambiguation; Word similarity; Word translation; Wordnet; Natural language processing systems; Software agents; Syntactics; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863698182

Instead, CBMT relies on a lightweight translation model utilizing a fullform bilingual dictionary and a sophisticated decoder using long-range context via long n-grams and cascaded overlapping. The translation process is enhanced via in-language substitution of tokens and phrases, both for source and target, when top candidates cannot be confirmed or resolved in decoding. Substitution utilizes a synonym and near-synonym generator implemented as a corpus-based unsupervised learning process. Decoding requires a very large target-language-only corpus, and while substitution in target can be performed using that same corpus, substitution in source requires a separate (and smaller) source monolingual corpus. Spanish-to-English CBMT was tested on Spanish newswire text, achieving a BLEU score of 0.6462 in June 2006, the highest BLEU reported for any language pair. Further testing also shows that quality increases above the reported score as the target corpus size increases and as dictionary coverage of source words and phrases becomes more complete. © 2006 The Association for Machine Translation in the Americas.",,"Bilingual dictionary; Context-based; Corpus size; Language pairs; Machine translations; N-grams; Parallel text; Translation models; Translation process; Decoding; Semantics; Translation (languages); Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863253368

The paper looks at some of the key linguistic and design issues behind the implementation of these fun translation websites, and concludes discussing their impact on the reputation of Internet-based MT tools, considering how they might affect users' trust in real online MT services.",,"Design issues; Internet based; Machine translations; Online machines; Source text; Speaking styles; Target language; Software engineering; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857591872

When is the output of one MT engine more likely than the output of another engine to support people performing an extraction task? This paper reports on the results of a one-of-a-kind, large-scale, MT evaluation experiment where nearly sixty subjects extracted who, when, and where-type elements of information (EIs) from output generated by three types of Arabic-English MT engines. Our hypothesis was that, in an end-to-end (MT engine and user) evaluation, the best extraction results would come from subjects working with output from MT engines that reordered Arabic input to generate English word order, rather than from an engine that did not, i.e., from a statistical or a rule-based, rather than from a substitution-based MT engine. The results of the experiment were not as straight-forward as expected: (1) non-response rates were statistically comparable across all three evaluated MT engines, while (2) correct response rates were statistically comparable on two engines, the statistical and substitution-based engines that yielded better (higher) rates than the rule-based engine did, and (3) incorrect response rates were statistically comparable on a different pair of two engines, the rule- and substitution-based engines that yielded significantly worse (higher) rates than the statistical engine. While these results do indicate that the statistical engine yielded significantly better rates than at least one of the other two engines on two of the three metrics, the lack of uniform results pre-empts an across-the-board ranking of the engines. Our next step is to incorporate the collected data in statistical models and test for their adequacy in predicting these task results from faster and less expensive, automatic metrics. The long-term goal is to understand which metrics accurately predict MT users' task effectiveness with different MT engines on text-handling tasks of varying levels of difficulty.",,"Automatic metrics; English word; Extracting information; Long-term goals; Machine translations; MT evaluations; Response rate; Rule based; Statistical models; Task-based; Experiments; Information theory; Statistics; Surveys; Engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857588263

It has been observed that stem-based training is better than lemma-based training when up to 1 million running words of data are used. In this paper a new word-alignment training technique is proposed by exploiting syntactically motivated constraints to the parallel data. Preliminary experimental results show that stem-based training with syntactically motivated constraints gives significant improvement in translation performance.

The load of detecting a clause hierarchy in a complex sentence is shifted to the generator. Transfer combines an interlingual and a syntactic transfer approaches.

However, even among formalisms with the same parse complexity, some formalisms better realize the desired characteristics for machine translation formalisms than others. We introduce a particular formalism, probabilistic synchronous treeinsertion grammar (PSTIG) that we argue satisfies the desiderata optimally within the class of formalisms that can be parsed no less efficiently than context-free grammars and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art word-based and phrasebased finite-state translation models on training and test data taken from the EuroParl corpus (Koehn, 2005).

Virtual Machine Monitors for x86, such as VMware Workstation and Virtual PC, have instead used binary translation of the guest kernel code. However, both Intel and AMD have now introduced architectural extensions to support classical virtualization.We compare an existing software VMM with a new VMM designed for the emerging hardware support. Surprisingly, the hardware VMM often suffers lower performance than the pure software VMM. To determine why, we study architecture-level events such as page table updates, context switches and I/O, and find their costs vastly different among native, software VMM and hardware VMM execution.We find that the hardware support fails to provide an unambiguous performance advantage for two primary reasons: first, it offers no support for MMU virtualization; second, it fails to co-exist with existing software techniques for MMU virtualization. We look ahead to emerging techniques for addressing this MMU virtualization problem in the context of hardware-assisted virtualization.

The ""move to head"" method is used by both the application and metarule bases for hypotheses formation. Whenever an application rule is fired, it is transposed on the transposition list and also moved to the head on the other list. If any meta-rule on a solution path individually leads to a contradiction on the application rule base, then the offending meta-rule is expunged.

Drawing upon prior research, we predicted differences in conversational efficiency and content, and in the shortening of referring expressions over trials. Quantitative results combined with interview data show that lexical entrainment was disrupted in machine translation-mediated communication because echoing is disrupted by asymmetries in machine translations. In addition, the process of shortening referring expressions is also disrupted because the translations do not translate the same terms consistently throughout the conversation.

However, sentence aligned parallel corpora are more efficient than non-aligned parallel corpora for cross language information retrieval and machine translation applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to align sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based on feed forward neural network classifier. A feature parameter vector is extracted from the text pair under consideration. This vector contains text features such as length, punctuate score, and cognate score values. A set of manually prepared training data has been assigned to train the feed forward neural network. Another set of data was used for testing. Using this new approach, we could achieve an error reduction of 60% over length based approach when applied on English-Arabic parallel documents. Moreover this new approach is valid for any language pair and it is quite flexible approach since the feature parameter vector may contain more/less or different features than that we used in our system such as lexical match feature. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","English/Arabic parallel corpus; Machine translation; Parallel corpora; Sentence alignment","article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; computer language; feedback system; human; language; natural language processing; statistical model; Artificial Intelligence; Feedback; Humans; Language; Models, Statistical; Multilingualism; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks (Computer); Programming Languages; Translating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846668240

Meanwhile, VLAN is being widely used in network configuration to meet the QoS and network management. Currently, with the growing of the network scale, basic VLAN service can not satisfy the requirements of most large-scale network deployment any more. So it is very important to provide enhanced VLAN service over EPON. In this paper, we propose a novel EPON system which can provide the automatic VLAN translation service. By comparing with the traditional way, it can be shown that the proposed system is much more economical and efficient to support the stacked VLAN function and VLAN translation function.","Automatic translation; EPON; VLAN translation","Broadband networks; Computer architecture; Local area networks; Optical communication; Passive networks; Quality of service; Telecommunication services; Automatic translation; Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON); Network configuration; Network management; Fiber optic networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845623685

While high quality output is still a far dream, most of the MT systems already commercialized are capable of reaching an understandable rendition to various subjects. Furthermore, more and more people begin to take advantage of various automatic translation tools as an aid in assembling information. However, a small investigation of several free MT systems on Internet reveals that these and also other systems still make errors while processing some common linguistic phenomena. These errors could be improved or avoided if more attention is paid on linguistic aspects such as certain language-specific structures, word order, etc. This paper based on a small investigation to the MT of some simplified medical texts discusses the common errors found in machine translations. By analyzing the errors from a linguistic point of view, it is suggested that many of these errors can be avoided or resolved by modifying grammar rules or adding some additional information to the databases. Finally, as a result of our own practice, some feasible solutions are also suggested.","Baconstruction; Error analysis; Language-specific phenomena; Machine translation (MT); Sentential structures; Structural particle de; Syntactic orders","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Error analysis; Errors; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Automatic translation; Baconstruction; Language-specific phenomena; Linguistic phenomena; Machine translations; Structural particle de; Text comprehensions; Translation quality; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959044214

This year we have used the same expansion technique, but taking into account some criteria of robustness: MAP, GMAP, MMR, GS@10, P@10, number of failed topics, number of topics bellow 0.1 MAP, and number of topics with P@10=0. In bilingual retrieval experiments three machine translation programs were used to translate topics. For the target language, translations were merged before performing a monolingual retrieval. We also applied the same local expansion technique. This year the results were disappointing. We think out that the reason is the difficulty to select the best measurement for robustness. Perhaps the problem is that all measurements are average results over all topics, but the hard topics are inherently hard and must be analyze separately. This year all our runs also ends up in good ranking, both base runs and expanded ones.

It claims that when a noun appears more than once in a discourse, all instances will share identical countability. The basic idea of the proposed method is that mispredictions can be corrected by efficiently using one countability per discourse heuristics. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully reinforces countability prediction and outperforms other methods used for comparison. In addition to its performance, it has two advantages over earlier methods: (i) it is applicable to any countability prediction method, and (ii) it requires no human intervention to reinforce countability prediction.

If a sequence of words has not been seen in training, it cannot be translated as a whole phrase. In this paper we try to overcome this drawback.

The ""Back Translation"" technique can improve the translation accuracy. A back translation, first, translates the input language into the target language (outward), and then translates the target language into the input language (homeward). This allows the users to confirm the accuracy of the machine translation by themselves. If the user finds that his input sentence is unsuitable for machine translator, he can rewrite the input sentence. For effective multilingual communication, it is important that the back translation offer good accuracy and good usability. This paper focuses on these two points; we evaluated the accuracy of back translation, and developed a user interface that improves the usability of back translation.

These measures provide a method for labeling each word in an automatically generated translation as correct or incorrect. All approaches to confidence estimation presented here are based on word posterior probabilities. Different concepts of word posterior probabilities as well as different ways of calculating them will be introduced and compared. They can be divided into two categories: System-based methods that explore knowledge provided by the translation system that generated the translations, and direct methods that are independent of the translation system. The system-based techniques make use of system output, such as word graphs or N-best lists. The word posterior probability is determined by summing the probabilities of the sentences in the translation hypothesis space that contains the target word. The direct confidence measures take other knowledge sources, such as word or phrase lexica, into account. They can be applied to output from nonstatistical machine translation systems as well. Experimental assessment of the different confidence measures on various translation tasks and in several language pairs will be presented. Moreover, the application of confidence measures for rescoring of translation hypotheses will be investigated. © 2007 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computer aided language translation; Probability; Automatically generated; Confidence estimation; Confidence Measure; Experimental assessment; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Translation systems; Word posterior probability; Computational linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047167453

Even if more powerful, recursive models can be used to account for more complex mappings, it has been argued that the input-output relations underlying most usual natural language pairs can essentially be modeled by finite-state devices. Moreover, the relative simplicity of these mappings has recently led to the development of techniques for learning finite-state transducers from a training set of input-output sentence pairs of the languages considered. In the last years, these techniques have lead to the development of a number of machine translation systems. Under the statistical statement of machine translation, we overview here how modeling, learning and search problems can be solved by using stochastic finite-state transducers. We also review the results achieved by the systems we have developed under this paradigm. As a main conclusion of this review we argue that, as task complexity and training data scarcity increase, those systems which rely more on statistical techniques tend produce the best results. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007.","Grammatical inference; Machine translation; Stochastic finite-state transducers","Conformal mapping; Finite automata; Formal languages; Problem solving; Security of data; Transducers; Translation (languages); Grammatical inference; Machine translation; Stochastic finite state transducers; Task complexity; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845194768

This article looks at the technology that allows for the sharing of TM databases over the internet to find out how it shapes the translator's working environment. It shows that so-called pre-translation-until now the standard way for clients to manage translation tasks with freelancers-is giving way to web-interactive translation. Thus, rather than interacting with their own desktop databases as before, translators now interface with each other through server-based translation memories, so that a newly entered term or segment can be retrieved moments later by another translator working at a remote site. The study finds that, while the interests of most stakeholders in the localisation process are well served by this web-based arrangement, it can involve drawbacks for freelancers. Once an added value, technical expertise becomes less of a determining factor in employability, while translators lose autonomy through an inability to retain the linguistic assets they generate. Web-based TM is, therefore, seen to risk disempowering and de-skilling freelancers, relegating them from valued localisation partners to mere servants of the new technology. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Internationalization; Localization; Machine-aided translation; Translation memory; Web-based translation","Data storage equipment; Database systems; Occupational risks; Servers; Standards; Storage allocation (computer); Technology; (e ,3e) process; (OTDR) technology; Added values; Business media; Localisation; New technologies; Pre-translation; Remote sites; Server-based; Springer (CO); technical expertise; Translation memories; working environments; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749120990

For computers, the equivalent of ""society"" is ""database,"" and the equivalent of ""use"" is ""a way to search the database."" We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation.

For the purpose of reducing the translation ambiguities and generating grammatically correct and fluent translation output, we address the use of shallow linguistic knowledge, that is: (1) enriching a word with its morphosyntactic features, (2) obtaining shallow linguistically-motivated phrase pairs, (3) iteratively refining word alignment using filtered phrase pairs, and (4) building a language model from morphosyntactically enriched words. Previous studies reported that the introduction of syntactic features into SMT models resulted in only a slight improvement in performance in spite of the heavy computational expense, however, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of morphosyntactic features, when reliable, discriminative features are used. Our experimental results show that word representations that incorporate morphosyntactic features significantly improve the performance of the translation model and language model. Moreover, we show that refining the word alignment using fine-grained phrase pairs is effective in improving system performance. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The model predicts block neighbors to carry out a phrase-based translation that explicitly handles local phrase reordering. We use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log-linear block bigram model which uses real-valued features (e.g., a language model score) as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves (e.g., block bigram features). The model training relies on an efficient enumeration of local block neighbors in parallel training data. A novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training algorithm is presented that can easily handle millions of features. Moreover, when viewing SMT as a block generation process, it becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging, phrase chunking, or shallow parsing. Our novel approach is successfully tested on a standard Arabic-English translation task using two different phrase reordering models: a block orientation model and a phrase-distortion model. © 2007 ACM.","Machine learning; Maximum entropy; Statistical machine translation; Stochastic gradient descent","Block generation; Maximum entropy; Statistical machine translation; Stochastic gradient descent (SGD); Formal languages; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Natural language processing systems; Problem solving; Statistical methods; Automatic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547369506

Our main setting is a program logic for a subset of Java bytecode, which is sound and complete for a resource-annotated operational semantics. The latter employs resource algebras for measuring dynamic costs such as time, space and more elaborate examples. We describe examples of optimisation validation that we have formally verified in Isabelle/HOL using the logic.

The success of an SMTS is strongly dependent on the quality of its decoder. Most of the SMTS's published in current literature use approaches based on traditional optimization methods and heuristics. On the other hand, over the last few years there has been a rapid increase in the use of metaheuristics. These kinds of techniques have shown to be able to solve difficult search problems in an efficient way for a wide number of applications. This paper proposes a new approach based on evolutionary hybrid algorithms to translate sentences in a specific technical context. The algorithm has been enhanced by adaptive parameter control. The tests are carried out in the context of Spanish and then translated to English. The experimental results validate the superior performance of our method in contrast to a statistical greedy decoder.

In this approach using the text corpus, a vibhakti-chart (or subcategorization frames) is obtained. This vibhakti-chart plays a pivotal role in defining Association Rules that could be used more effectively for multiple parse disambiguation. The vibhakti-chart can be used further for finding agreement rules for verb and noun-groups with proper vibhaktis, for finding how many noun-groups have ambiguous grouping with or without vibhakti-charts, and also to know whether verbs obtained be grouped into classes. An Indian language text corpus has been used for the work. It is a collection of more than 250 stories, and the total size is about 100000 words.

Since the early 1960s, researchers have been building and utilizing computer systems that can translate from one language to another without requiring extensive human intervention. In the late 1990s, Ford Vehicle Operations began working with Systran Software Inc. to adapt and customize its machine-translation technology in order to translate Ford's vehicle assembly build instructions from English to German, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. The use of machine translation was made necessary by the vast amount of dynamic information that needed to be translated in a timely fashion. The assembly build instructions at Ford contain text written in a controlled language as well as unstructured remarks and comments. The MT system has already translated more than 7 million instructions into these languages and is an integral part of the overall manufacturing process-planning system used to support Ford's assembly plants in Europe, Mexico and South America. In this paper, we focus on how AI techniques, such as knowledge representation and natural language processing can improve the accuracy of machine translation in a dynamic environment such as auto manufacturing.

Authors of scientific articles in one language are often required to provide abstracts of their papers in a second language, and they use a variety of ways to achieve this. Aims. The aims of our studies were (i) to assess the effects of using native English speakers to improve non-native speakers' translations of their abstracts, and (ii) to explore the variations in edits produced by different native speakers. Methods. In Study 1, a French abstract was translated into English by two French authors. Each of these English abstracts was then edited by two native speakers of English (leading to four abstracts altogether). Textual and stylistic analyses were made of these four abstracts. In Study 2, over 200 academics rated these four abstracts on a series of semantic-differential scales to see how readers judged each abstract and what discriminations they made between them. Results. Study 1 showed how the two English editors imposed their own particular styles of writing on to the anglicized French abstracts, and how each changed the meaning in different ways. Study 2 showed that readers did in fact evaluate these pairs of English abstracts differently, indicating that the two English editors wrote in recognizably different 'voices', whilst ostensibly carrying out the same task. Comparing the results of Study 1 (using textual analyses) with those of Study 2 (using readers' judgements), it appeared that improving readability and changing style were independent skills, and each had differing effects on meaning and understanding. Conclusions. These data suggest that there are benefits from using native English speakers to edit translated abstracts, but that there will never be a 'one-to-one' translation from one language to another, and that different measures may reveal different effects. © CILIP.","Author's voice; Automatic translation; Non-native speakers; Readability; Writing styles","Abstracting; Data acquisition; File editors; Intelligent systems; Knowledge based systems; Technical writing; Automatic translation; Native speakers; Stylistic analyses; Writing styles; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748905919

However, finding translations for technical phrases is difficult. Bilingual dictionaries have limited coverage for specialized fields, and even more limited coverage of technical phrases. Since phrases can have very specific meanings in technical fields, this limits the quality of translations produced by generic machine translation systems. We hypothesize that digital libraries of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) are a good source of technical phrase translations. We have acquired a collection of 3,086 Spanish ETDs about computer science from Scirus, the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Mexico City), and Universidad de las Américas (Puebla).

However, machine translation systems give poor performance for their large cost. In this paper, a machine translation system is proposed for cross-lingual information retrieval that alleviates the large cost of standard machine translation systems while increasing performance. The system combines multiple web based translation services, which allows for a low cost solution to the translation problem. By examining the translations of multiple systems, better translation can be done. The system uses heuristics to decide if the best translation should be chosen by picking a consensus translation or using statistical analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to produce better translations than the individual systems that are used to create candidate translations.",,"Consensus translations; Cross-lingual information retrieval; Individual systems; Low-cost solution; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Standard machines; Web-based translation; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided language translation; Information retrieval systems; Pattern recognition; Content based retrieval",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876748668

In this paper we describe a platform independent and object oriented implementation (in Java) of a word alignment algorithm. This algorithm is based on the first three IBM models. This is an ongoing work in which we are trying to explore the possible enhancements to the IBM models, especially for related languages like the Indian languages. We have been able to improve the performance by introducing a similarity measure (Dice coefficient), using a list of cognates and morph analyzer. Use of information about cognates is especially relevant for Indian languages because these languages have a lot of borrowed and inherited words which are common to more than one language. For our experiments on English-Hindi word alignment, we also tried to use a bilingual dictionary to bootstrap the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. After training on 7399 sentence aligned sentences, we compared the results with GIZA++, an existing word alignment tool. The results indicate that though the performance of our word aligner is lower than that of GIZA++, it can be improved by adding some techniques like smoothing to take care of the data sparsity problem. We are also working on further improvements using morphological information and a better similarity measure etc. This word alignment tool is in the form of an API and is being developed as part of Sanchay, (a collection of tools and APIs for NLP with focus on Indian languages).

The POS tagging and parsing is done using statistical methods, as it is one of the modern and successful methods among all. The conversion of an English parse tree to a Bengali parse tree is done using a normalization technique. The Bengali sentence is finally generated applying a proper context disambiguation check.

Unlike traditional transfer-based MT architectures, this model only requires a set of CSG rules for modeling syntactic structures of two languages simultaneously to perform the translation.

We demonstrate that combination with the new alignment technique yields up to 2.9 BLEU point improvement over the best input system and up to 1.3 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art combination method on two different language pairs. © 2008 Licensed under the Creative Commons.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Alignment technique; Combination method; Confusion networks; Language pairs; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; State of the art; State-of-the-art system; Alignment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053412157

To accomplish this, the training procedure determines for each feature function its exact error surface on a given set of candidate translations. The feature function weights are then adjusted by traversing the error surface combined over all sentences and picking those values for which the resulting error count reaches a minimum. Typically, candidates in MERT are represented as N-best lists which contain the N most probable translation hypotheses produced by a decoder. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that allows for efficiently constructing and representing the exact error surface of all translations that are encoded in a phrase lattice. Compared to N-best MERT, the number of candidate translations thus taken into account increases by several orders of magnitudes.

However, there are only a few techniques to infer such models. One of these techniques is the grammatical inference and alignments for transducer inference (GIATI) technique that has proven to be very adequate for speech translation, text-input machine translation, or computer-assisted translation. GIATI is a heuristic technique that requires segmented training data (i.e., the input sentences and the output sentences must be segmented with the restriction that the input segments and the output segments must be monotone aligned). For the purpose of obtaining segmented training data, pure statistical word-alignment models are used. This technique is revisited in this article. The main goal is to formally derive the complete GIATI technique using classical expectation-maximization statistical estimation procedure. This new approach allows us to avoid a hard dependence on heuristic ""external"" statistical techniques (statistical alignments and n-grams). A first set of experimental results obtained in a machine-translation task are also reported to initially validate this new version of the inference technique of finite-state transducers.",,"Computational linguistics; Heuristic algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Optimal control systems; Parameter estimation; Statistical methods; Finite-state transducers; Grammatical inference and alignments for transducer inference (GIATI); Statistical estimation; Text-input machine; Transducers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40149086517

Alignments are used, on the one hand, to train the statistical models and, on the other, during the decoding process to link the words in the source sentence to the words in the partial hypotheses generated. In both cases, the quality of the alignments is crucial for the success of the translation process. In this paper, we propose several evolutionary algorithms for computing alignments between two sentences in a parallel corpus. This algorithm has been tested on different tasks involving different pair of languages. Specifically, in the two shared tasks proposed in the HLT-NAACL 2003 and in the ACL 2005, the EDA-based algorithm outperforms the best participant systems. In addition, the experiments show that, because of the limitations of the well known statistical alignment models, new improvements in alignments quality could not be achieved by using improved search algorithms only. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was trained on data gathered in 2007 from various sets of proteins containing experimentally verified chemical modifications of proteins. Short sequence segments around a modification site were dissected from a parent protein, and represented in the training set as binary or profile vectors.

Given that the use of translation and MT post-editing are increasing the demand for language-skilled professionals, in this article we aim at evaluating the use of MT post-editing in the foreign language class. For this purpose we make use of computer-aided error analysis (CEA) to extract patterns of error found in translation and MT post-editing into the foreign language. This methodology will provide some insights as to the main difficulties found by the students in post-editing into the foreign language and about the suitability of using raw MT output as input for foreign language written production. Thus, a comparative analysis of error frequency is performed on the results of a group of advanced students of Spanish doing post-editing as compared to another group doing translation in order to gauge the level of difficulty of MT post-editing as opposed to translation into the foreign language.","Computer-aided error analysis; Foreign language written production; Learner corpus; Machine translation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449092761

The performance of a machine translation system depends heavily on precise translation of the inclusive NEs. Furthermore, organization name (ON) is the most complex NE for translation among all the NEs. In this article, the structure formulation of ONs is investigated and a hierarchical structure-based ON translation model for Chinese-to-English translation system is presented. First, the model performs ON chunking; then both the translation of words within chunks and the process of chunk-reordering are achieved by synchronous context-free grammar (CFG). The CFG rules are extracted from bilingual ON pairs in a training program. The main contributions of this article are: (1) defining appropriate chunk-units for analyzing the internal structure of Chinese ONs; (2) making the chunk-based ON translation feasible and flexible via a hierarchical CFG derivation; and (3) proposing a training architecture to automatically learn the synchronous CFG for constructing ONs with chunk-units from aligned bilingual ON pairs. The experiments show that the proposed approach translates the Chinese ONs into English with an accuracy of 93.75% and significantly improves the performance of a baseline statistical machine translation (SMT) system. © 2008 ACM.","Alignment; Chunk; Hierarchical derivation; Machine translation; Named entity; Organization name; Rules extraction; Structural analysis; Synchronous context-free grammar","Machine translation; Rules extraction; Synchronous context-free grammar; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Text processing; Translation (languages); Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39149114710

Following previous works that apply complex networks concepts to text quality measurement, summary evaluation, and author characterization, we now focus on machine translation (MT). In this paper we assess the possible representation of texts as complex networks to evaluate cross-linguistic issues inherent in manual and machine translation. We show that different quality translations generated by MT tools can be distinguished from their manual counterparts by means of metrics such as in- (ID) and out-degrees (OD), clustering coefficient (CC), and shortest paths (SP). For instance, we demonstrate that the average OD in networks of automatic translations consistently exceeds the values obtained for manual ones, and that the CC values of source texts are not preserved for manual translations, but are for good automatic translations. This probably reflects the text rearrangements humans perform during manual translation. We envisage that such findings could lead to better MT tools and automatic evaluation metrics. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Complex networks; Machine translation; Network measurements; Translation quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249086340

A long sentence has been known to spend enormous computational time and space when it is analyzed syntactically. It can also produce poor translation results. To resolve this problem, we partitioned a long sentence into a few segments to analyze each segment separately. To partition the sentence, firstly, we tried to find candidates for each segment position in the sentence. We then generated input vectors representing lexical contexts of the corresponding candidates and also used the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm to learn and recognize the appropriate segment positions. We used three kernel functions, the linear kernel, the polynomial kernel and the Gaussian kernel, to find optimal hyperplanes classifying proper positions and we compared results obtained from each kernel function.

The model assumes that CLIR performance can be explained by two factors: (1) the ease of search inherent in each query and (2) the translation quality in the process of CLIR systems. As operational variables, monolingual information retrieval (IR) performance is used for measuring the ease of search, and the well-known evaluation metric BLEU is used to measure the translation quality. This study also proposes an alternative metric, weighted average for matched unigrams (WAMU), which is tailored to gauging translation quality for special IR purposes. The data for regression analysis are obtained from a retrieval experiment of English-to-Italian bilingual searches using the CLEF 2003 test collection. The CLIR and monolingual IR performances are measured by average precision score. The result shows that the proposed regression model can explain about 60% of the variation in CLIR performance, and WAMU has more predictive power than BLEU.

In the last few years, research in SMT has been characterized by two significant advances. First, the popularization of the so called phrase-based statistical translation models, which allows to incorporate local contextual information to the translation models. Second, the availability of larger and larger parallel corpora, which are composed of millions of sentence pairs, and tens of millions of running words. Since phrase-based models basically consists in statistical dictionaries of phrase pairs, their estimation from very large corpora is a very costly task that yields a huge number of parameters which are to be stored in memory. The handling of millions of model parameters and a similar number of training samples have become a bottleneck in the field of SMT, as well as in other well-known pattern recognition tasks such as speech recognition or handwritten recognition, just to name a few. In this paper, we propose a general framework that deals with the scaling problem in SMT without introducing significant time overhead by means of the combination of different scaling techniques. This new framework is based on the use of counts instead of probabilities, and on the concept of cache memory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, since the translation is done on a single bytecode basis, a naive implementation of the JVM generates frequent memory accesses for local variables which can be not only a performance bottleneck but also an obstacle for instruction folding. A solution to this problem is to add a small register file to the data path of the microprocessor which is dedicated for storing local variables. However, the effectiveness of such a local variable register file depends on the size and the local variable access behavior of the applications. In this paper, we analyze the local variable access behavior of various Java applications. In particular, we will investigate the fraction of local variable accesses that are covered by the register file of a varying size, which determines the chip area overhead and the operation speed. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the sliding register window for parameter passing in context of JVM and on-the-fly optimization of local variable to register file mapping. With two types of exceptions, a 16-entry register file achieves coverages of up to 98%. The first type of exception is represented by the SAXON XSLT processor for which the effect of cold miss is significant. Adding the sliding window feature to the register file for parameter passing turns 6.2-13.3% of total accesses from miss to hit to the register file for the SAXON with XSLTMark. The second type of exception is represented by the FFT, which accesses more than 16 local variables for most of method invocations. In this case, on-the-fly profiling is effective. The hit ratio of a 16-entry register file for the FFT is increased from 44% to 83% by an array of 8-bit counters. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we introduce the concept of the Controlled Korean we have developed for a Korean-English MT system and compare the Controlled Korean with the Controlled English and Controlled German from the perspective of the translatability.

We propose a multilingual summarizer that operates at the Deep-Syntactic Structures (DSyntSs) as introduced in the Meaning-Text Theory. Firstly, the original claims are linguistically simplified and analyzed down to DSyntSs. Then, syntactic and discursive summarization criteria are applied to the DSyntSs to remove summary irrelevant DSyntS-branches. The pruned DSyntS are transferred into DSyntSs of the language in which the summary is to be generated. For the generation of the summary from the transferred DSyntSs, we use the full fledged text generator MATE.","Deep-Syntactic Structure; Machine translation; Meaning-Text Theory; Patent claims; Summary","Machine translations; Meaning-Text Theory; Multilingual summarization; Patent claims; Summary; Information theory; Patents and inventions; Syntactics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051474991

The authors have recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs) from subjects viewing four types of Kanji (Chinese characters being used currently in the Japanese language) and arrows that were presented on a CRT. Each denoted direction for upward, downward, leftward and rightward, respectively. Subjects were asked to read them silently. Regardless of the directions, the reaction time was almost equal. EEGs were averaged for each stimulus type and direction, and event related potentials (ERPs) were obtained. The equivalent current dipole source localization (ECDL) method has been applied to these ERPs. In both cases, no large difference was observed until 250 ms at their latencies, and after that ECDs were localized to areas related to the working memory for the spatial perception. Taking into account these facts, the authors have investigated a single trial EEGs precisely after the latency at 400ms, and have determined effective sampling latencies for the discriminant analysis on four types of arrows: ↑, ↓, ← and →. By a discriminant analysis, the results of discriminant rate are 100% for each subject and for each trial. These results show the possibility of using EEGs for a brain machine interface in four type controls.

It is a two-step flow process because first we extract single-word units from the source language and then the multi-word units where the initial single units are instantiated. For each of the multi-word units, we see if they appear in texts from the web in the target language. The unit of the target language that appears more frequently across the sets of multi-word units is usually the correct translation of the initial single-word source language entry.","Bilingual lexicon extraction; Corpus linguistics; Knowledge-poor methods; Machine translation; Specialized terminology; Statistical methods","Bilingual lexicons; Comparable corpora; Corpus linguistics; Flow process; Knowledge-poor methods; Machine translations; Multi-word; PoS tagging; Source language; Target language; Information theory; Statistical methods; Software agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76749087320

We propose an operand exchange unit (OPEXU) for maximizing compatibility and a stack management unit (SMU)with a smart exception handler for minimizing the overhead by stack exceptions. Javelin increases hardware cost less than 9,000 gates including a 256-byte SRAM and does not decrease the clock frequency of host processor.

These experiments were designed aiming at setting a baseline scenario for future training and testing of more complex statistical translation models such as the factored ones.

The proposed model is an extension of IST-ITG (imposing source tree on inversion transduction grammar) constraints. In the proposed method, the targetside word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side parse-tree. We modeled the node rotation, monotone or swap, using word alignments based on a training parallel corpus and source-side parse-trees. The model efficiently suppresses erroneous target word orderings, especially global orderings. Furthermore, the proposed method conducts a probabilistic evaluation of target word reorderings. In English-to-Japanese and English-to-Chinese translation experiments, the proposed method resulted in a 0.49-point improvement (29.31 to 29.80) and a 0.33-point improvement (18.60 to 18.93) in word BLEU-4 compared with IST-ITG constraints, respectively.

Reordering is understood as the word-order redistribution of the translated words. In original SMT systems, this different order is only modeled within the limits of translation units. Relying only in the reordering provided by translation units may not be good enough in most language pairs, which might require longer reorderings. Therefore, additional techniques may be deployed to face the reordering challenge. The Statistical Machine Translation community has been very active recently in developing reordering techniques.

Each of the four characters or symbols denoted direction for upward, downward, leftward and rightward, respectively. Subjects were asked to read the characters or symbols, silently. EEGs were averaged for each stimulus type and direction, and event related potentials (ERPs) were obtamed. The equivalent current dipole source localiza (ECDL) method has been applied to these ERPs. In both cases, equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) were localized to areas related to the working memory for spatial perception, such as the right upper or the right middle frontal areas. Taking into account these facts, the authors have investigated a single trial EEGs of the subject precisely after the latency at 400 ms, and it was determined effective sampling latencies for the analysts to four types of arrow: ↑, ↓, ← and →. EEG data have been sampled at latency from 400 ms to 900 ms at 25 ms interval by the three channels in the right upper and the right middle frontal gyri.

By introducing a mass distribution factor, the simplified dynamic equations have been derived via the virtual work principle and validated on a virtual prototype with the ADAMS software package. Based upon the established model, three dynamics controllers have been attempted on the 3-PRC PKM. The intuitive co-simulations with the combination of MATLAB/Simulink and ADAMS show that the control performance of neither inverse dynamics control nor robust inverse dynamics control is satisfactory in the presence of parametric uncertainties in PKM dynamics. On the contrary, the controller based on the passivity-based robust control scheme is more suitable for tracking control of the PKM in terms of both control performances and controller design procedures.

The conventional error transformation matrix (ETM) is derived based on the differentiation of kinematic equations, and a new error amplification index (EAI) over a usable workspace is proposed as an error performance index for the optimization. To validate the efficiency of the PSO method, both the traditional direct search method and the genetic algorithm (GA) are implemented as well. The simulation results not only show the advantages of PSO method for the architectural optimization, but also reveal the necessity to introduce the EAI for the optimal design.

(2004). Rum, tid och pengar - En studie om redovisning i praktiken. Doctoral Thesis, Göteborg: BAS]. It starts conceptually by seeing accounting and its references as a 'chain of translations' [Latour, B. (1998). Artefaktens återkomst. Stockholm: Knowledge and Society; Latour, B. (1999). Pandora's hope. Essays on the reality of science studies. Cambridge: Harvard University Press]. Empirically it follows a puzzling set of such references, from a psoriasis clinic where accounting is unfamiliar - so part of what [Tuan, Y. -F. (2001). Space and place, 8th ed. London: University of Minnesota Press] would call a 'space' - to a central finance function where it is taken for granted embodied knowledge, and so part of 'place', and then back, to observe how these references become integrated into medical everyday work and its embodied ways of knowing, establishing the clinic as an accounting 'place' for those who work there.. It then argues that as these references become more taken for granted, accounting acts as a special Actor because of the way it circulates inside and outside both human and non-human 'actants', as a machine which always names and counts, so constituting space, time and valuing through its flexible 'named numbers'.. It tracks how accounting moves to becoming familiar and expands its reach through four categories: 'the character of the associations', 'the integration of associations and the delimitation of movement', 'order and its relation to change; and 'the production of other spaces'. This illuminates how accounting draws actants into its chains or circuits of value, thus extending its ability to construct both facts and acts. Here the paper supplements the actor-network approach with ideas drawn from the work of Hoskin and colleagues [e.g. Ezzamel, M., & Hoskin, K. (2002). Retheorizing the relationship between accounting, writing and money with evidence from Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 13, 333-367; Hoskin, K. (1981).

Accounting, Organisation and Society, 11, 105-136] which see accounting as a visible sign system naming and counting from before the invention of writing, and so having a special priority in settings concerned with coordinating action in space and across time. In modern managerial worklife settings, its named numbers circulate as paper and electronic texts which are strategically central to both financial and non-financial coordination of resources and actants. This helps clarify why accounting should be such a special Actor, as well as how it functions as machine. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper has developed a new electronic meeting technology that automatically translates comments written in any of 41 languages (e.g. French, Chinese, etc.). The purpose of this paper is to quickly and accurately show on each user's terminal in his or her own native language all comments contributed by the group written in several different tongues. Design/methodology/approach - A prototype system, Polyglot II, utilizes instant messaging on Microsoft Windows PCs to exchange comments between client personal computers and a server which in turn, calls the Google Translate API for each translation. In an attempt to measure the accuracy, reverse translations are conducted, e.g. English to French to English, because of the lack of human experts fluent in all of the languages. The final English translations are analyzed for comprehension by 240 college business students. Findings - This paper uses reverse translations on 32 of the languages (all that are available at the time of the analysis) with historical transcripts of English text, including grammatical errors. Results show an overall comprehension accuracy of 86 percent for all languages. Italian is the most accurate, and Hindi is the least. Originality/value - While other multilingual meeting technologies have been developed, this system provides automatic support for the most languages and is perhaps the most accurate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Electronic media; Group decision support systems; Language; Meetings; Translation services","Electronic media; Group decision support systems; Language; Meetings; Translation services; Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Communication; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Linguistics; Personal computers; Query languages; Students; Telecommunication services; Windows operating system; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70149101093

Nigeria stock market prices were collected for the periods of seven hundred and twenty days and grouped into untranslated and translated train, validation and test data. A zero mean unit variance transformation was used to normalize the input variables in order to allow the same range which makes them to differ by order of magnitude. A 5-j-1 network topology was adopted because of five input variables in which variable j was determined by the number of hidden neurons during network selection. The untranslated and translated data served as input into the error back propagation algorithm and regression model which were written in Java Programming Language. The results of both untranslated and translated statements were analyzed and compared. The performance of translated NSMP using regression analysis or error back propagation was more superior than untranslated NSMP. The results also showed that percentage prediction accuracy of error back propagation model on untranslated NSMP ranged for 11.3% while 2.7% was for translated NSMP. The 2.7% percent accuracy as against 11.3% indicates the relative stability of translated NSMP prediction as against untranslated NSMP. The mean relative percentage error was very low in all hidden topologies of error back propagation of translated NSMP than untranslated NSMP. This indicates that translated NSMP prediction approach was superior to untranslated NSMP predicition. © 2005 - 2009 JATIT.

Reducing the overhead of emulating condition codes is a critical performance issue in binary translation. In this paper, we propose a two-phase optimization approach for condition codes, which has been implemented in Crossbit - a machine adaptable dynamic binary translator (DBT). First, redundant flag computing code in a basic block is reduced based on the information collected by Crossbit when the block is identified. Then, lazy evaluation technique is used inter basic blocks, which make the condition codes emulation more efficient. Experimental results show that this method works much better than the straightforward emulation method - it eliminate the code size more than 20% and have a performance gain nearly 40% in Crossbit. The data proves that the approach is effective to remove the redundant code and to increase the performance of the translated code. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Basic blocks; Binary translation; Code size; Computing codes; Lazy evaluation; Performance Gain; Performance issues; Phase optimization; Redundant codes; Binary codes; Computer science",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049154127

An alternative is the so-called Interactive Machine Translation (IMT) framework. In this framework, the knowledge of a human translator is combined with a MT system. We present a new technique for IMT which is based on the generation of partial alignments at phrase-level. The proposed technique partially aligns the source sentence with the user prefix and then translates the unaligned portion of the source sentence. The generation of such partial alignments is driven by statistical phrase-based models. Our technique relies on the application of smoothing techniques over the phrase models to appropriately assign probabilities to unseen events. We report experiments investigating the impact of the different smoothing techniques in the accuracy of our system. In addition, we compare the results obtained by our system with those obtained by other well-known IMT systems.","Interactive machine translation; Phrase-based alignments; Phrase-based translation; Smoothing; Statistical machine translation","Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Partial alignment; Smoothing; Smoothing techniques; Statistical machine translation; Alignment; Natural language processing systems; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866880516

In our approach, this sense assignment or disambiguation problem is transformed into one on how to navigate through a sense network like WordNet aimed at distinguishing the more adequate senses from others. The method involves automatically constructing classification models for branching nodes in the network, and automatically learning to reject less probable senses, based on the translation characteristics of word senses and semantically-related word groups (e.g., lexicographer files) respectively. At run-time, translation pairs are expanded with their synonyms and sense ambiguity is resolved using a greedy algorithm choosing the most likely branches based on the trained classification models. Evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the strong baseline of assigning most frequent sense to the translation pairs and effectively determines suitable word senses for given translation pairs, suggesting the possibility of employing our method as a computer-assisted tool for speeding up the process of lexicography or of using our method to assist machine translation systems in word selection. © 2009 by Tzu-yi Nien, Tsun Ku, Chung-chi Huang, Mei-hua Chen, and Jason S.

However, a central issue in MT evaluation is the high correlation that the metrics should have with human judgments of translation quality. In order to achieve a higher correlation, the identification of sense correspondences between the compared translations becomes really important. Given that most metrics are looking for exact correspondences, the evaluation results are often misleading concerning translation quality. Apart from that, existing metrics do not permit one to make a conclusive estimation of the impact of Word Sense Disambiguation techniques into MT systems. In this paper, we show how information acquired by an unsupervised semantic analysis method can be used to render MT evaluation more sensitive to lexical semantics. The sense inventories built by this data-driven method are incorporated into METEOR: they replace WordNet for evaluation in English and render METEOR's synonymy module operable in French.

Two languages that feature such an interface to a common language can even interoperate by means of this common intermediate language. Smalltalk and Java, for example, both offer an interface to C and can therefore interoperate through a connection of these interfaces. However, the resulting interactions will need to occur at the level of abstraction offered by the (low-level) C interfaces, although both Java and Smalltalk are object-oriented languages. In this paper, we describe how the dynamic and reflective facilities of the Smalltalk language permits us to raise the level of abstraction of these inter-language interactions to seamless message passing between objects. In addition, we introduce and explore the concept of language shifting objects where Java objects are not only represented in Smalltalk but can partially or completely migrate from Java to Smalltalk.

This study investigates the difficulties of constructing common ground when multiparty groups (consisting of more than two language communities) communicate using machine translation. We compose triads whose members come from three different language communities-China, Korea, and Japan-and compare their referential communication under two conditions: in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using machine translation. Consequently, our study suggests the importance of not only grounding between speaker and addressee but also grounding between addressees in constructing effective machine-translation-mediated communication. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground between addressees, it seems important for them to be able to monitor what is going on between a speaker and other addressees.

In many cases, developers often do not internationalize a software application at the beginning of the development stage. To internationalize such an existing application, developers need to externalize some hard-coded constant strings to resource files, so that translators can easily translate the application to be in a local language without modifying its source code. Since not all the constant strings require externalization, locating those need-to-translate constant strings is a basic task that the developers must conduct. In this paper, we present TranStrL, an Eclipse plug-in tool that automatically locates need-to-translate constant strings in Java code. Our tool maintains a pre-collected list of API methods related to the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and then searches for need-totranslate strings in the source code starting from the invocations of these API methods using string-taint analysis. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Development stages; Java codes; Local language; Plug-ins; Resource files; Software applications; Source codes; Graphical user interfaces; Location; Computer software",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949887368

Different from previous researches, it dose not depend on any special field in any packet. The network traffic is represented by 8 features and filtered by activity value which is calculated by the proposed function.

ATML defines classes that represent automatic test system (ATS) components, such as test description, test results and instrument description, and the interoperability between classes. As an emerging standard, ATML classes have different levels of definition and adoption. One of the most adopted classes in the ATML standard is Test Description (TD). Organizations are expecting the adoption of the ATML TD standard to reduce the development and maintenance costs for test program sets (TPSs). ATML TD documents describe the types of measurements an ATE must perform but not the way the ATE must perform them. Translating an ATML TD document to a TPS consists of defining the necessary instrumentation, switching, and software automation. Manually translating an ATML TD to a TPS requires significant time and effort. In contrast, automatic translation methods can reduce development time. This paper discusses a method for translating ATML TD documents to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) test executive, a graphical programming language, and ANSI C. It also examines how ATML TD constructs such as test group, test action, test name, and behavior can be mapped to constructs in the COTS test executive and programming languages. As the industry continues to adopt additional ATML standards, TD translators will be able to further automate the generation of TPSs. With the goal of catalyzing future work in the area, the paper closes with a proposal of how to improve a translation from a TD to a TPS with the information in other ATML standards such as Test Configuration, Test Station, UUT Description, Instrument Description, and Test Adapter. ©2009 IEEE.","ATML; COTS; Test description; Test executive; TPS","Automatic test; Automatic test markup languages; Automatic test system; Automatic translation; Commercial-off-the-shelf; Common format; Development time; Graphical programming language; IMPROVE-A; Maintenance cost; Naval air systems commands; Programming language; Software automation; Test configurations; Test program sets; Test results; Test station; Automatic testing; Computer software; Cost reduction; Fluorine containing polymers; Heat shielding; Light weight rolling stock; Linguistics; Maintenance; Markup languages; Military aircraft; Program translators; Query languages; Standardization; XML; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249097465

Lhis task has a strict relation with the task of automatic machine translation, but there are some differences: Cross-lingual lexical substitution targets one word at a time and the main goal is to find as many good translations as possible for the given target word. Moreover, there are some connections with Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms. Indeed, understanding the meaning of the target word is necessary to find the best substitutions. An important aspect of this kind of task is the possibility of finding synonyms without using a particular sense inventory or a specific parallel corpus, thus allowing the participation of unsupervised approaches.

Collaborative machine translation systems do not only translate the input sentence into a target language but also back-translate the translation into the input language in a reverse way, and the user can repair the input sentence to improve the quality of translation referring to the back translation. However, it is not easy for novice users to repair the input sentence appropriately to be translated correctly. We propose a guided input method that assists the users to compose input sentences by presenting word candidates that may lead to a correct translation. The word candidates are generated from the sentence structure and word database that is created by storing input sentences that have been translated correctly. We evaluate the performance of the guided input method depending on the number of input sentences stored in the database. As the number of input sentences increases in the database, the performance of the method improves because the number of correct translations increases and the number of repairs decreases in an experiment of Japanese-Chinese translation. On the other hand, in an experiment of Japanese-English translation, the performance of the method is not so remarkable. The guided input method works better when the users are not familiar with the target language.","Back translation; Collaborative machine translation; Guided input method","Computational linguistics; Database systems; Repair; Back translations; Collaborative machine translations; Guided input methods; Machine translations; Novice user; Sentence structures; Target language; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858857994

The syntax-oriented MT is a kind of literal translation which may be regarded as an idealized competence of today's practical MT. The above comparison shows that the main reason for the incompleteness of current practical MT systems is the insufficient ability to treat structural ambiguousness of sentences. With the help of Recursive Transition Network (RTN), N-S Flowchart techniques for structured programming and Context-Free Grammar (CFG), the translation examples present that, without understanding the total meaning of the source sentence, it is quite difficult to manipulate the garden path phenomenon in sentence structure. Garden path effect on sentence structure usually originates from syntactic differences, so that the syntax-free computational translation of these sentences is a very difficult problem. However, encouraging evidence is provided that the principal technologies of today's hybrid-knowledge-based MT have sufficient potential for producing barely acceptable translation. Garden path sentence possesses the features of processing breakdown and backtracking, which bring lingering effect on automatic processing. Only on the basis of hybrid knowledge databases of MT system can the suffering from garden path effect on sentence structure be alleviated and can robustness of MT system be enhanced. © 2010 IEEE.","Context-free grammar; Garden path phenomenon; Machine translation; N-S flowchart; Recursive transition network","Computer aided language translation; Context free grammars; Flowcharting; Intelligent systems; Knowledge based systems; Structured programming; Syntactics; Automatic processing; Computational translations; Embedded structures; Garden path; Literal translations; Machine translations; Recursive transition networks; Sentence structures; Program translators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955769511

However, the query interface provides semantic constraints, some attributes are co-occurred and the others are exclusive sometimes. To generate a valid query, we have to reconcile the key attributes and semantic relation between them. We design a framework to automatically extract attributes from query interfaces taking full advantage of instances information and enrich the attribute sets embedded in the semantic query interface by Ontology technique.

This poses a significant challenge to MT due to the vast number of ways to express the same sentence in Arabic. The ordering features are very important and should be carefully applied to ensure the generation of sentence in the target language. Because they apply to the target language, it should fulfill the specific requirement of this language. Mistakes in the MT output can be either the result of analysis problems at the source language level, or due to generation problem at target language level. Word order rules are crucial for the generation of sentences in the target language. They also serve as rules for the ordering of sentence constituents. These rules draw their information from the syntactic knowledge. The word order problem becomes more obvious when making machine translation between languages that have rich morphological variations. Approach: The main objective of this research is to develop a machine translation that translates Arabic noun phrases into English by using transfer-based approach. A system called Npae-Rbmt has been developed in this research. Transfer-based machine translation is one instance of rulebased machine-translation approaches and is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation. The idea of transfer-based machine translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the ""meaning"" of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation. Using advantages of transfer-based machine translation such as analysis step, the Transfer-based becomes simpler as linguistic analysis goes deeper-as the representation of analysis step becomes more abstract. In fact, a major goal of MT research is to define a level of analysis which is so deep in which transfer-based machine translation is able to do. Results: The method was tested on 88 thesis titles and journals from the computer science domain. The accuracy of the result was 94.6%. These results proved the viability of this approach for distant languages. Conclusion: Based on the achieved results, we have managed to perform the syntactic reordering within an Arabic noun phrases to English translation task by using transfer-based machine translation and also achieved reasonable improvements in translation quality over related approach. © 2010 Science Publications.","Arabic language processing; Machine translation; Noun phrases; Npae-Rbmt; Transfer-based approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952508884

In this paper, a part of the Eurogene platform related to the retrieval and machine translation of domain specific content is described. Our contribution lies in an approach for domain-specific adaption of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT). The CLIR system is based on a multilingual domain ontology which is also used as a synchronization component between CLIR and MT. The MT system is adapted to the target domain using the terminology represented in the ontology and using statistical training performed on a collection of parallel texts. In the statistical training phase, new translations of a term can be discovered and used for ontology updating. The paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the motivation for our approach and the multilingual domain ontology.

The characteristics of inflective languages are generally not taken into account by the statistical machine translation system. Existing translation systems often treat different inflected word forms of the same lemma as if they were independent of each other, although some interdependencies exist. On the other hand we know that if we reduce inflected word forms to common lemmas, some information is lost. It would be reasonable to eliminate only the variations in inflected word forms, which are not relevant for translation. Inflectional features of words are defined by morpho-syntactic descriptions (MSD) tags and we want reduce them. To do this the explicit knowledge about both languages (source and target language) is needed. The idea of the paper is to find the information-bearing MSDs in source language by data-driven approach. The task is performed by a global optimization algorithm, named Differential Evolution. The experiments were performed using freely available parallel English-Slovenian corpus SVEZ-IJS, which is lemmatized and annotated with MSD tags.

Reordering poses a serious problem for statistical machine translation systems and has generated a considerable body of research aimed at meeting its challenges. Direct evaluation of reordering requires automatic metrics that explicitly measure the quality of word order choices in translations. Current metrics, such as BLEU, only evaluate reordering indirectly. We analyse the ability of current metrics to capture reordering performance. We then introduce permutation distance metrics as a direct method for measuring word order similarity between translations and reference sentences. By correlating all metrics with a novel method for eliciting human judgements of reordering quality, we show that current metrics are largely influenced by lexical choice, and that they are not able to distinguish between different reordering scenarios. Also, we show that permutation distance metrics correlate very well with human judgements, and are impervious to lexical differences. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","BLEU; Human evaluation; Machine translation; METEOR; Metrics; Permutation distances; Reordering; TER","BLEU; Human evaluation; Machine translations; METEOR; Metrics; Permutation distances; Reordering; TER; Semantics; Information theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650066410

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classification. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a finite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classifier has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions. Our experiments on artificial and real-world benchmark data sets, including the USPS and the MNIST digit recognition data sets, show the usefulness of the proposed method. © 2010 Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Reza Safabakhsh and Mostafa Shamsi.","Capacity control; Classification; Kernel learning; Semi-infinite programming; Support vector machines; Translation invariant kernels","Benchmark data; Binary classification; Capacity control; Class-based; Constrained quadratic programming; Cosine functions; Data sets; Digit recognition; Feature space; Finite mixtures; Functional formulation; Gaussian kernels; Kernel function; Kernel learning; Kernel matrices; Kernel methods; Kernel trick; Large-scale problem; Learning capacity; Learning process; Optimal classifiers; Real-world; Runtimes; Semi infinite programming; Sub-problems; Support vector; Translation invariants; Feature extraction; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Support vector machines; Program translators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951970597

The efficacy of online translators when performing as tools in QA systems is analysed using a collection of documents in the Spanish language. Design/methodology/approach: Automatic translation is evaluated in terms of the functionality of actual translations produced by three online translators (Google Translator, Promt Translator, and Worldlingo) by means of objective and subjective evaluation measures, and the typology of errors produced was identified. For this purpose, a comparative study of the quality of the translation of factual questions of the CLEF collection of queries was carried out, from German and French to Spanish. Findings: It was observed that the rates of error for the three systems evaluated here are greater in the translations pertaining to the language pair German-Spanish. Promt was identified as the most reliable translator of the three (on average) for the two linguistic combinations evaluated. However, for the Spanish-German pair, a good assessment of the Google online translator was obtained as well. Most errors (46.38 percent) tended to be of a lexical nature, followed by those due to a poor translation of the interrogative particle of the query (31.16 percent). Originality/value: The evaluation methodology applied focuses above all on the finality of the translation. That is, does the resulting question serve as effective input into a translingual QA system? Thus, instead of searching for ""perfection"", the functionality of the question and its capacity to lead one to an adequate response are appraised. The results obtained contribute to the development of improved translingual QA systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer applications; Error analysis; Knowledge management; Languages; Quality improvement; Translation services",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951459698

It has been established, through numerous demonstrations for particular conjunctions of application kernel, programming languages, and GPU hardware instance, that it is possible to achieve significant improvements in the price/performance and energy/performance over general purpose processors. But these demonstrations are each the result of significant dedicated programmer labor, which is likely to be duplicated for each new GPU hardware architecture to achieve performance portability. This paper discusses the implementation, in the R-Stream compiler, of a source to source mapping pathway from a high-level, textbook-style algorithm expression method in ANSI C, to multi-GPGPU accelerated computers. The compiler performs hierarchical decomposition and parallelization of the algorithm between and across host, multiple GPGPUs, and within-GPU. The semantic transformations are expressed within the polyhedral model, including optimization of integrated parallelization, locality, and contiguity tradeoffs. Hierarchical tiling is performed. Communication and synchronizations operations at multiple levels are generated automatically. The resulting mapping is currently emitted in the CUDA programming language. The GPU backend adds to the range of hardware and accelerator targets for R-Stream and indicates the potential for performance portability of single sources across multiple hardware targets.

DBTs, however, have high memory demands because they cache translated code and auxiliary code to a software code cache and must also maintain data structures to support the code cache. The high memory demands make it difficult for memory-constrained embedded systems to take advantage of DBT-based tools. Previous research on DBT memory management focused on the translated code and auxiliary code only. However, we found that data structures are comparable to the code cache in size. We show that the translated code size, auxiliary code size and the data structure size interact in a complex manner, depending on the path selection (trace selection and link formation) strategy. Therefore, holistic memory efficiency (comprising translated code, auxiliary code and data structures) cannot be improved by focusing on the code cache only. In this paper, we use path selection for improving holistic memory efficiency which in turn impacts performance in memory-constrained environments. Although there has been previous research on path selection, such research only considered performance in memory-unconstrained environments. The challenge for holistic memory efficiency is that the path selection strategy results in complex interactions between the memory demand components. Also, individual aspects of path selection and the holistic memory efficiency may impact performance in complex ways. We explore these interactions to motivate path selection targeting holistic memory demand. We enumerate all the aspects involved in a path selection design and evaluate a comprehensive set of approaches for each aspect. Finally, we propose a path selection strategy that reduces memory demands by 20% and at the same time improves performance by 5-20% compared to an industrial-strength DBT.

Lysine acetylation sites are recognized by acetyltransferases and deacetylases through sequence patterns (motifs). Recently, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 human proteins covering most of the previously annotated sites and providing the most comprehensive acetylome so far. This dataset should provide an excellent source to train support vector machines (SVMs) allowing the high accuracy in silico prediction of acetylated lysine residues.

However, extracting performance on such a configuration would typically require programming in both MPI and CUDA, thus requiring a high degree of expertise and effort. It is clearly desirable to be able to support higherlevel programming of this emerging high-performance computing platform. This paper reports on a code generation system that can translate data mining applications on a GPU cluster. Our work is driven by the observation that a common processing structure, that of generalized reductions, fits a large number of popular data mining algorithms. In our solution, the programmers simply need to specify the sequential reduction loop(s) with some additional information about the parameters. We use program analysis and code generation to automatically map the applications to the API of FREERIDE, which is a middleware for parallel data mining. We also automatically generate CUDA code for using the GPU on each node of the cluster. We have evaluated our system using two popular data mining applications, k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Determining whether a protein contains a SUMOylation site or not thus provides essential clues about its intra-nuclear spatial association and function. We investigate if the SUMOylation site prediction accuracy can be improved by using machine learning methods integrating non-local and (predicted) structural properties (including secondary structure, solvent accessibility and evolutionary profiles).We use a range of properties available from a target protein's amino acid sequence and the support-vector-machine to demonstrate that local sequence features enable best generalization, with structural features having little to no impact. The support-vector-machine model for SUMOylation sites based on the primary protein sequence achieves an area under the ROC of 0.92 using fivefold cross-validation, and 96% accuracy on an independent hold-out test set, which is superior to previously published methods. However, using a simple consensus motif to scan sequence data exhibits equal performance with reduced computational time and no bias towards the chosen training data. We show that the simple consensus motif makes biologically reasonable predictions and use it to identify specific sites that may explain the dual role ascribed to a set of transcription factors in Drosophila melanogaster. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Post-translational modification; SUMOylation; Transcriptional regulation","Amino acid sequence; Computational time; Consensus motif; Cross validation; Drosophila melanogaster; Dual role; Gene regulations; Local sequences; Machine learning methods; Machine models; Machine-learning; Nonlocal; Post-translational modifications; Prediction accuracy; Protein sequences; Secondary structures; Sequence data; Solvent accessibility; Specific sites; Structural feature; Sumoylation; Target proteins; Test sets; Training data; Transcriptional regulation; Amino acids; Learning systems; Organic acids; Structural properties; Transcription factors; Transcription; transcription factor; accuracy; amino acid sequence; article; binding site; computer prediction; controlled study; Drosophila melanogaster; genetic variability; nonhuman; performance measurement system; priority journal; protein analysis; protein database; protein motif; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; proteomics; solvent effect; structure analysis; sumoylation; support vector machine; transcription regulation; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955324858

Source-side fragments consist of variable-length phrases in a local context of neighboring words, translated by the classifier to a target-language phrase. We compare three methods of phrase extraction, and present a new decoder that reassembles the translated fragments into one final translation. Results show that one of the proposed phrase-extraction methods-the one used in Moses-leads to a translation system that outperforms context-sensitive word-based approaches. The differences, however, are small, arguably because the word-based approaches already capture phrasal context implicitly due to their source-side and target-side context sensitivity.",,"Context sensitivity; Context-sensitive; Example-based machine translation; Machine translations; Phrase extraction; Translation systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874006355

In this talk I will introduce a serial of statistical translation models based on source syntax structure. The tree-based model uses the one best syntax tree for translation. The forest-based model uses a compact forest which encodes exponential number of syntax trees in a polynomial spaces and lead to better performance. The joint parsing and translation model produces source parse trees, using the source side of the translation rules instead of separate parsing rules, and generate translations on the target side simultaneously, which outperforms the forest-based model.

This paper introduces a spectral clustering framework that automatically estimates the optimal N and removes unstable oscillating points. The new framework produces significant improvements in low-resource EBMT settings for English-to-French (≈1.4 BLEU points), English-to-Chinese (≈1 BLEU point), and English-to-Haitian (≈2 BLEU points).

In contrast, in our approach, a rich overlappingphrase alignment is produced by a fast deterministic method, while probabilistic decoding infers only the target sentence, which is then able to leverage arbitrary features of the entire source sentence, target sentence and alignment.

Experimental results on the NIST Chinese-to-English MT evaluation tasks show that our approach brings significant improvements to single system-based MBR decoding and outperforms a state of- the-art system combination method.",,"Decision rules; Decoding methods; General method; Minimum bayes risk; Mixture distributions; MT evaluations; Multiple machine; Multiple systems; Search spaces; SMT systems; System combination; System-based; Computational linguistics; Mixtures; Translation (languages); Decoding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053429978

Various evaluation metrics have been proposed, and BLEU is now used as the de facto standard metric. However, when we consider translation between distant language pairs such as Japanese and English, most popular metrics (e.g., BLEU, NIST, PER, and TER) do not work well. It is well known that Japanese and English have completely different word orders, and special care must be paid to word order in translation. Otherwise, translations with wrong word order often lead to misunderstanding and incomprehensibility. For instance, SMT-based Japanese-to-English translators tend to translate 'A because B' as 'B because A.' Thus, word order is the most important problem for distant language translation. However, conventional evaluation metrics do not significantly penalize such word order mistakes. Therefore, locally optimizing these metrics leads to inadequate translations.

This introduces a bias in the development cycle which in some cases has been reported to carry very negative consequences.

We have compiled a rich set of specialized similarity measures operating at different linguistic dimensions and analyzed their individual and collective behaviour over a wide range of evaluation scenarios. Results show that measures based on syntactic and semantic information are able to provide more reliable system rankings than lexical measures, especially when the systems under evaluation are based on different paradigms.

As well as providing a comprehensive review of the paradigm, Somers gives a categorisation of the different instantiations of the basic model. In this paper, we provide a complementary view to that of Somers. Today's EBMT systems learn by analogy. Perhaps even more so than statistical models of translation, one might view these systems as being incapable of forgetting. We researchers and system developers, on the other hand, often forget or are ignorant of techniques and models presented in prior research. The primary aim of this paper is to try to ensure that golden nuggets from past (now quite distantly so) EBMT research papers are gathered together and presented here for a new generation of researchers keen to operate in the paradigm, especially given the spate of recent open-source releases of EBMT systems. We revisit the findings of the previous main research papers, relate them to some of the major research efforts which have taken place since then, and examine especially the prophecies given in the older pieces of work to see the extent to which they have been borne out in the newer research. Given the strong convergence between the leading corpus-based approaches to MT, especially since the introduction of phrase-based statistical MT, a further hope is that these findings may also prove useful to researchers and developers in other areas of MT. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation; Alignment; Convergence between paradigms; Decoding; Example-based machine translation; Generalized templates; Historical development; Hybrid models; Phrase alignment; Postprocessing; Preprocessing; Recombination; Retrieval; Scalability; Search; Statistical machine translation; String-based models; Subtree alignment; Tree-based models; Word alignment","Adaptation; Convergence between paradigms; Example-based machine translation; Generalized templates; Historical development; Hybrid models; Phrase alignment; Postprocessing; Preprocessing; Recombination; Retrieval; Search; Statistical machine translation; String-based models; Subtrees; Tree-based model; Word alignment; Alignment; Information theory; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955815908

Also, the impact of new features in combination with state-of-the-art features introduced in the literature is systematically evaluated.

In order to better understand the problem characteristics, four supervised classification algorithms are used to classify sentence pairs as noise or parallel.

Most research done to date has focused on algorithms for tuning parameters. However, the selection of development corpus is lack of discussion. It is believed that the parameters trained on a proper corpus will improve translation performance. Instead of exploring new algorithms, this paper aims to select development corpus for tuning parameters according to the test set. We address this problem as domain adaptation and propose two methods based on information retrieval (IR) technique and text clustering (TC) technique, respectively.

In this paper we deal with the root word of Bangla sentence. We show here how to use the root word to translate the Bangla sentence into English Sentence. We deal here first to find out the root word from the database. Here is also an alternative to use the morphological analyzing. After that we define the parts of speech of that sentence. Then we detect the proper grammatical structure of that sentence. Then we find the grammar for the targeted language.

In this framework, a human iteratively interacts with a system until the output desired by the human is completely generated. Traditionally, interaction has been performed using a keyboard and a mouse. However, the use of touchscreens has been popularised recently. Many touchscreen devices already exist in the market, namely mobile phones, laptops and tablet computers like the iPad. In this work, we propose a new interaction modality to take advantage of such devices, for which online handwritten text seems a very natural way of input. Multimodality is formulated as an extension to the traditional IMT protocol where the user can amend errors by writing text with an electronic pen or a stylus on a touchscreen. Different approaches to modality fusion have been studied. In addition, these approaches have been assessed on the Xerox task. Finally, a thorough study of the errors committed by the online handwritten system will show future work directions. © 2010 ACM.","interactive machine translation; interactive pattern recognition; multimodality","Alternative approach; Amend error; Automatic translation; Electronic pen; Human expertise; interactive pattern recognition; Machine translations; Modality Fusion; Multi-modal; Multi-modality; On-line handwritten text; Tablet computer; Touch screen; Errors; Interactive computer systems; Laptop computers; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Telecommunication equipment; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650962605

Being pertinent even to structurally dissimilar language pairs, it has confirmed its suitability for large text translation. Rising demand is present for automatic translation between Sinhala and Tamil for quite a lot of decades. Statistical approach is the best preference to resolve the unavailability of a machine translation tool for the languages concerned. Because of language similarity, statistical approach could thrive agreeably, exclusive of more concern on linguistic knowledge. A basic translation system has been modelled and implemented in this research, with the preparation of parallel corpora from parliament order papers. This paper demonstrates only the preliminary system runs of the research, devoid of various parameter refinements and actual design and evaluation strategies. Language Model, Translation Model and Decoder Configurations are done consistent with recent literature. To facilitate the improvement of output quality, MERT technique is integrated to tune the decoder. To stay away from sole dependence on BLEU, two other automatic metrics namely TER and NIST are utilised for the evaluation in different aspects.

The conducted experiments on French newspapers and on a set of scientific documents show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline model. The second method focuses on the machine translation and is motivated by the results of triggers on statistical language modeling. In order to build up a translation table, association rules and triggers are then generalized to mine bilingual corpora. In this respect, we propose respectively the concepts of inter-lingual association rules and inter-lingual triggers. Both methods have been integrated in a real statistical machine translation.

When an EBMT system finds an example in the translation memory, it tries to modify the sentence in order to produce the best possible translation of the input sentence. The user of the system, however, is unable to judge the quality of the translation. This problem can be solved by providing the user with a percentage score for each translated sentence. The idea to base transfer score computation on the similarity between the input sentence and the example is not sufficient. Real-life examples show that the transfer process is as likely to go well with a bad translation memory example as to fail with a good example. This paper describes a method of computing transfer score strictly associated with the transfer process. The transfer score is inversely proportional to the number of linguistic operations executed on the example target sentence.

Due to the complicated syntactic structure of the language, many ambiguous parse trees can be generated during the translation process, and it is not easy to select the most suitable parse tree for generating the correct translation. This paper presents an approach to parse and translate long sentences efficiently in application to Rule based Portuguese-Chinese Machine Translation. A systematic approach to break down the length of the sentences based on patterns, clauses, conjunctions, and punctuation is considered to improve the performance of the parsing analysis.

Mostly English-to-Urdu machine translation systems were developed without considering the target language and also semantics are not included in existing systems. This alarming problem generates several issues during Natural Language Processing.

We compare referential communication of pairs and triads under two conditions: in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using machine translation. Consequently, to support natural referring behaviour in machine translation mediated communication between pairs, our study suggests the importance of resolving the asymmetries and inconsistencies caused by machine translations. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground among triads, it is important for addressees to be able to monitor what is going on between a speaker and other addressees.

Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on the problem recently and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, existing approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings. Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting SVM, Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include PRank, OC SVM, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, LambdaRank, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed. © 2018 by Morgan & Claypool.","collaborative filtering; information retrieval; learning to rank; machine translation.; natural language processing; ranking; ranking aggregation; ranking creation; supervised learning; web search","Collaborative filtering; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data handling; Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Supervised learning; Websites; Learning to rank; Machine translations; ranking; Ranking aggregation; ranking creation; Web searches; Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970915255

MLIF is being designed in order to fulfill the multilingual needs of today's applications. By developing the Multilingual-Assisted Chat Interface, we wanted to help people communicate in virtual worlds with others who do not speak the same language and to offer new possibilities for learning foreign languages. We also wanted to show the advantages of using web services for externalizing computation: we used the same web service for two virtual worlds: Second Life and Solipsis.

In this article, we propose a framework for automatic error analysis and classification based on the identification of actual erroneous words using the algorithms for computation of Word Error Rate (WER) and Position-independent word Error Rate (PER), which is just a very first step towards development of automatic evaluation measures that provide more specific information of certain translation problems. The proposed approach enables the use of various types of linguistic knowledge in order to classify translation errors in many different ways. This work focuses on one possible set-up, namely, on five error categories: inflectional errors, errors due to wrong word order, missing words, extra words, and incorrect lexical choices. For each of the categories, we analyze the contribution of various POS classes. We compared the results of automatic error analysis with the results of human error analysis in order to investigate two possible applications: estimating the contribution of each error type in a given translation output in order to identify the main sources of errors for a given translation system, and comparing different translation outputs using the introduced error categories in order to obtain more information about advantages and disadvantages of different systems and possibilites for improvements, as well as about advantages and disadvantages of applied methods for improvements. We used Arabic-English Newswire and Broadcast News and Chinese-English Newswire outputs created in the framework of the GALE project, several Spanish and English European Parliament outputs generated during the TC-Star project, and three German-English outputs generated in the framework of the fourth Machine Translation Workshop. We show that our results correlate very well with the results of a human error analysis, and that all our metrics except the extra words reflect well the differences between different versions of the same translation system as well as the differences between different translation systems. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82255179850

In statistical methods, ambiguity resolution is mostly carried out by making use of some statistics extracted from previously translated documents or dual corpora of source and target languages. In this paper, we look at the problem from a different viewpoint. The proposed system consists of two main parts. The first part includes a data mining algorithm which runs offline and extracts some useful knowledge about the co-occurrences of the words. The second part of the system is an expert system whose knowledge base includes the set of association rules generated by the first part. For the inference engine of the expert system, we propose an efficient algorithm based on forward chaining in order to deduce the correct senses of the words. The performance of the system in terms of applicability and precision will be analyzed and discussed through a set of experiments.","Ambiguity resolution; Association rule mining; Expert systems; Forward chaining; Machine translation; Word sense disambiguation","Association rules; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Expert systems; Inference engines; Natural language processing systems; Ambiguity resolution; Data mining algorithm; Example-based methods; Forward chaining; Machine translations; Target language; Word Sense Disambiguation; Word sense disambiguation systems; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80755141276

Solutions to this problem are of general interest for text mining in the multilingual context and have specific applications in statistical machine translation. Our approach takes advantage of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) techniques to project feature vectors from one language into another, and then uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to extract similar pairs. We show that effective cross-lingual pairwise similarity requires working with similarity thresholds that are much lower than in typical monolingual applications, making the problem quite challenging. We present a parallel, scalable MapReduce implementation of the sort-based sliding window algorithm, which is compared to a brute-force approach on German and English Wikipedia collections. Our central finding can be summarized as ""no free lunch"": there is no single optimal solution. Instead, we characterize effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs in the solution space, which can guide the developer to locate a desirable operating point based on application- and resource-specific constraints.","LSH; Machine translation; Wikipedia","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Information retrieval; Cross-language information retrieval; Locality sensitive hashing; Machine translations; Multilingual context; Similarity threshold; Sliding window algorithms; Statistical machine translation; Wikipedia; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052108188

Presented algorithms differ from existing algorithms in consideration of the presence of human translator which usage we are trying to minimize. We treat human translator as an oracle who knows exact alignments and the goal of the system is to optimize (minimize) the use of this oracle. The effectiveness of the oracle is measured by the speed at which he can create ""perfectly"" aligned bilingual corpus. By ""Perfectly"" aligned corpus we mean zero entropy corpus because oracle can make alignments without any probabilistic interpretation, i.e., with 100% confidence. Sentence level alignments and word-to-word alignments, although treated separately in this paper, are integrated in a single framework. For sentence level alignments we provide a dynamic programming algorithm which achieves low precision and recall error rate. For word-to-word level alignments Expectation Maximization algorithm that integrates linguistic dictionaries is suggested as the main tool for the oracle to build ""perfectly"" aligned bilingual corpus.

The MT architecture proposed reuses several open-source tools and is based on a unique XML format to facilitate the flow between the different modules, which eases the interaction among different developers of tools and resources. The result is the rule-based Matxin MT system, an open-source toolkit, whose first implementation translates from Spanish to Basque.

It argues that maintaining the appropriate quality level in this setting is a collaborative task which involves several translators. This perspective entails taking a broader view of the translation process than usually found in the Machine Translation (MT) literature and detailing the various knowledge sources which are deployed in this collaborative effort. The impact of collaboration on trust is examined, and a comparison is made between the relatively seamless flow of work between translators and the more strained relationships with remote contributors. In support of this view, the paper contrasts the flexibility of the analysed work practices with the rigid ways which tend to be followed when introducing MT into this setting. We identify the need to support collaboration and communication more actively as a broader issue in translation settings.While current strategies for introducing MT tend to further isolate translators from remote contributors, we propose that MT can serve as the catalyst for establishing a more dynamic and collaborative relationship between them. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Collaboration; Contextual analysis; Flexibility; Localisation; Qualitative study; Translation practice; Translation process; Translation quality; Trust","Collaboration; Contextual analysis; Flexibility; Localisation; Qualitative study; Translation process; Translation quality; Trust; Information theory; Distributed computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054889017

From a practical perspective, the expected results of many morphological operators can be intuitively explained in terms of geometrical and topological characteristics of the images. From a formal perspective, mathematical morphology is based on complete lattices, which provides a solid theoretical framework for the study of algebraic properties of the operators. Despite of these nice characteristics, designing morphological operators is not a trivial task; it requires knowledge and experience. In this chapter, a self-contained exposition on the design of translation-invariant morphological operators from training data is presented. The described training procedure relies on the canonical sup-decomposition theorem of morphological operators, which in the context of binary images states that any translation-invariant operator can be expressed uniquely in terms of two elementary operators, erosions and dilations, plus set operations. An important issue considered in this exposition is how the bias-variance tradeoff manifests within the training context and how its understanding can lead to approaches that generate better results. Several application examples that illustrate the usefulness of the described design procedure are also presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","automatic design; bias-variance tradeoff; Boolean function; morphological operator; training; translation-invariance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952123616

These template-based approaches (G-EBMT) find common patterns in the bilingual corpus to generate generalized templates. In the past, patterns in the corpus were found by only few of the following ways: finding similar or dissimilar portions of text in groups of sentence-pairs, finding semantically similar words, or use dictionaries and parsers to find syntactic correspondences. This paper combines all the three aspects for generating templates. In this paper, the boundaries for aligning and extracting members (phrase-pairs) for clustering are found using chunkers (hence, syntactic information) trained independently on the two languages under consideration. Then semantically related phrase-pairs are grouped based on the contexts in which they appear. Templates are then constructed by replacing these clustered phrase-pairs by their class labels. We also perform a filtration step by simulating human labelers to obtain only those phrase-pairs that have high correspondences between the source and the target phrases that make up the phrase-pairs. Templates with English-Chinese and English-French language pairs gave significant improvements over a baseline with no templates. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","data sparsity; Generalized Example-based Machine Translation (G-EBMT); Template Induction; Unsupervised Clustering","Bilingual corpora; Class labels; Corpus-based machine translation; Data sparsity; Example-based machine translation; Language pairs; Syntactic information; Template Induction; Template-based; Translation quality; Unsupervised Clustering; Computational linguistics; Equivalence classes; Information theory; Syntactics; Text processing; Word processing; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952259172

In our approach we integrate the popular picture-book, in which the user simply points to multiple picture icons representing what they want to say, with a statistical machine translation system that can translate arbitrary word sequences. The simple pointing at pictures paradigm is used as the primary method of user input and the users can use the device as if it were a picture book. The application is then able to generate a complete sentence in the user's native language for what they wish to say from the sequence of picture icons chosen by the user. Once the user is satisfied that the sentence provided by the system adequately represents what they wish to convey, the application can automatically translate the sentence into the language of the other party, who can interpret the intended meaning of the first party by combining evidence from both modes of communication: the picture sequence, and the machine translation. The prototype system we have developed inherits many of the positive features of both approaches, while at the same time mitigating their main weaknesses. The user may combine the pictures in considerably more combinations than is possible with a picture book designed with combinations from only within the same page spread of the book in mind, making the application more expressive than a book. The machine translation system can contribute a detailed and precise translation which is supported by the picture-based mode which not only provides a rapid method to communicate basic concepts but also gives a 'second opinion' on the machine transition output that catches machine translation errors and allows the users to retry the sentence, avoiding misunderstandings. © 2011 ACM.","Dialog; Language model; Mobile; Multimodal; Phrasebook; Touch-screen interface; Translation","Dialog; Language model; Mobile; Multi-modal; Phrasebook; Touch screen; Translation; Communication; Computational linguistics; Human computer interaction; Information theory; Mobile devices; User interfaces; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952745408

Moreover studies on applying syntax-based language models in syntax-based SMT models were carried out. However no studies, to our best knowledge, have been conducted to incorporate syntax-based into phrase-based SMT models, which are still dominating models in the SMT area. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to incorporate syntax-based language models into phrase-based SMT systems. The syntax-based language model used in this paper is based on link grammar, which is a high lexical formalism. In order to apply language models based on link grammar in phrase-based models, we brought out the concept of linked phrases, which is an extension of the concept of traditional phrases in phrase-based models. Experiments were conducted and the results showed that the use of syntax-based language models could improve the performance of the phrase- based models greatly. © 2011 International Information Institute.","Linkage grammar; Phrase-based translation models; Statistical machine translation; Syntax-based language models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860213536

All modern processors feature hardware performance counters, but current virtual machine monitors (VMMs) do not properly expose them to the guest operating systems. Existing profiling tools require privileged access to the VMM to profile the guest and are only available for VMMs based on paravirtualization. Diagnosing performance problems of software running in a virtualized environment is therefore quite difficult. This paper describes how to extend VMMs to support performance profiling. We present two types of profiling in a virtualized environment: guest-wide profiling and system-wide profiling. Guest-wide profiling shows the runtime behavior of a guest. The profiler runs in the guest and does not require privileged access to the VMM. System-wide profiling exposes the runtime behavior of both the VMM and any number of guests. It requires profilers both in the VMM and in those guests. Not every VMM has the right architecture to support both types of profiling. We determine the requirements for each of them, and explore the possibilities for their implementation in virtual machines using hardware assistance, paravirtualization, and binary translation. We implement both guest-wide and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on the x86 hardware virtualization extensions and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on binary translation. We demonstrate that these profilers provide good accuracy with only limited overhead.

We show that NCD scores given for MT outputs in different languages correlate highly with scores of a state-of-the-art MT evaluation metrics, METEOR 0.6. Our experiments are based on translations between one source and three target languages with a smallish sample that has available reference translations, UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Secondly we shall also briefly describe and discuss results of a larger scale evaluation of NCD as an MT metric with WMT08 Shared Task Evaluation Data. These evaluations confirm further that NCD is a noteworthy MT metric both in itself and also enriched with basic language tools, stemming and Wordnet. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","evaluation of machine translation systems; machine translation; MT metrics; Normalized Compression Distance","CompLearn; General tools; Human rights; Language tools; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; MT evaluations; MT metrics; Normalized compression distance; Quality measures; Quality tools; Target language; Wordnet; Language independents; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; MT metrics; Normalized compression distance; Quality measures; State of the art; Target language; Information theory; Translation (languages); Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Translation (languages); Quality control; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953212206

However, it is too costly and time-consuming to collect and read all of the papers in the field for the purpose of this analysis. Therefore, we have constructed a system that can recognize the application of elemental technologies to any research field. We focus on the structure of research papers' titles for the extraction of elemental technologies. In research papers' titles, particular expressions, such as ""using"" or ""is based on"", are often used. The terms immediately after these expressions are considered elemental technologies. Therefore, we used these expressions as cue phrases, and extracted elemental technologies from both English and Japanese titles. We conducted experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our method for analyzing the structure of titles. We obtained Recall and Precision scores of 0.825 and 0.816, respectively, for the analysis of Japanese titles, and scores of 0.735 and 0.780, respectively, for English titles.

Second, it trains a model based on learning to rank framework to select the most relevant reordering rule based on source language context features. The learned model is used to restructure a source sentence in order to have similar word order with a target sentence.

The paper also describes OpenLogos resources and their customization to specific application domains. One of the key aspects of rule-based machine translation systems intelligence is the symbology employed by these systems in representing natural language internally. The paper offers details about the OpenLogos semantico-syntactic abstract representation language known as SAL. The paper also shows how OpenLogos has addressed classic problems of rule-based machine translation, such as the cognitive complexity and ambiguity encountered in natural language processing, illustrating how SAL helps overcome them in ways distinct from other existing rule-based machine translation systems. The paper illustrates how the intelligence inherent in SAL contributes to translation quality, presenting examples of OpenLogos output of a kind that non-linguistic systems would likely have difficulty emulating. The paper shows the unique manner in which OpenLogos applies the rulebase to the input stream and the kind of results produced that are characteristic of the OpenLogos output. Finally, the paper dealswith an important advantage of rule-based machine translation systems, namely, the customization and adaption to application-specific needs with respect to their special terminology and transfer requirements. OpenLogos offers users a set of comfortable customization tools that do not require special knowledge of the system internals. An overview of the possibilities that these tools provide will be presented. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Linguistic knowledge system; Machine translation system; Open source; OpenLogos; Rule-based machine translation; SAL representation language; Semantico-syntactic abstract language","Abstract languages; Linguistic knowledge; Machine translation systems; Open sources; OpenLogos; Representation languages; Rule based; Abstracting; Cognitive systems; Computational linguistics; Computer hardware description languages; Content based retrieval; Information theory; Natural language processing systems; Open systems; Syntactics; Translation (languages)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054807681

In an experiment translating children's books, we show that MonoTrans2 is able to substantially close the gap between machine translation and human bilingual translations.

In general, thread-level parallelization are performed using the source code of the target program, but the source code are not always available. In order to realize the parallelization of existing sequential programs without need of the source codes, we have developed the software system that can automatically parallelize the executable binary codes of the programs at thread level, with binary translation. For thread-level parallelization, it is necessary to correctly analyze the data dependencies of variables between threads. However, since the memory accesses for the reference of variables are performed by specifying the target addresses using the registers and the values of the registers are generally unknown until execution, it is not easy to identify the variables located on memory and to examine the data dependencies. This paper discusses the analysis for the data dependencies of variables located on memory and the thread-level parallel processing based on the analysis results, in our automatic thread-level parallelization system by binary translation. The binary-level variable analysis statically analyzes and identifies the variables on memory in order to examine the data dependencies between threads. This is the method for identifying the variable by comparing the calculation trees that represent the target addresses of variables. And the runtime inspection of memory access dependencies hardware guarantees the correct parallel execution for the parallelized binary code containing data dependencies that cannot statically determined.","Automatic parallelization; Binary translation; Memory access analysis; Speculative multithreading","Analysis results; Automatic Parallelization; Binary translation; Data dependencies; Memory access; Memory access analysis; Multi-core processor; Parallel executions; Parallel processing; Parallelizations; Runtimes; Sequential programs; Software systems; Source codes; Speculative multithreading; Variable analysis; Binary codes; Multitasking; Program translators; Multicore programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958085440

Typically, patent granting bodies translate patents into several major foreign languages, so that language boundaries do not hinder their accessibility. Given such multilingual patent collections, we posit that the patent translations can be exploited for facilitating patent retrieval. Specifically, we focus on the translation of patent queries from German and French, the morphology of which poses an extra challenge to retrieval. We compare two translation approaches that expand the query with (i) translated terms and (ii) translated phrases. Experimental evaluation on a standard CLEF-IP European Patent Office dataset reveals a novel finding: phrase translation may be more suited to French, and term translation may be more suited to German. We trace this finding to language morphology, and we conclude that tailoring the query translation per language can lead to improved results in patent retrieval. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","cross-language information retrieval; patent retrieval; query expansion; query translation; relevance feedback; statistical machine translation","Cross language information retrieval; Patent retrieval; Query expansion; Query translations; Relevance feedback; Statistical machine translation; Cross language information retrieval; Patent retrieval; Query expansion; Query translations; Relevance feedback; Statistical machine translation; Computational linguistics; Feedback; Information retrieval; Morphology; Patents and inventions; Translation (languages); Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Patents and inventions; Translation (languages); Search engines; Search engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959259623

All modern processors feature hardware performance counters, but current virtual machine monitors (VMMs) do not properly expose them to the guest operating systems. Existing profiling tools require privileged access to the VMM to profile the guest and are only available for VMMs based on paravirtualization. Diagnosing performance problems of software running in a virtualized environment is therefore quite difficult. This paper describes how to extend VMMs to support performance profiling. We present two types of profiling in a virtualized environment: guest-wide profiling and system-wide profiling. Guest-wide profiling shows the runtime behavior of a guest. The profiler runs in the guest and does not require privileged access to the VMM. System-wide profiling exposes the runtime behavior of both the VMM and any number of guests. It requires profilers both in the VMM and in those guests. Not every VMM has the right architecture to support both types of profiling. We determine the requirements for each of them, and explore the possibilities for their implementation in virtual machines using hardware assistance, paravirtualization, and binary translation. We implement both guest-wide and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on the x86 hardware virtualization extensions and system-wide profiling for a VMM based on binary translation. We demonstrate that these profilers provide good accuracy with only limited overhead.

Translation repair can improve the accuracy of translated sentences. Translation repair is typically only used when a user thinks that his/her message is inaccurate. As a result, translation accuracy suffers, because people's judgment in this regard is not always accurate. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method that provides users with an indication of the translation accuracy of their message. In this method, we measure the accuracy of translated sentences using an automatic evaluation method, providing users with three indicators: a percentage, a five-point scale, and a three-point scale. We verified how well these indicators reduce inaccurate judgments, and concluded the following: (1) the indicators did not significantly affect the inaccurate judgments of users; (2) the indication using a five-point scale obtained the highest evaluation, and that using a percentage obtained the second highest evaluation. However, in this experiment, the values we obtained from automatically evaluating translations were not always accurate. We think that incorrect automatic-evaluated values may have led to some inaccurate judgments. If we improve the accuracy of an automatic evaluation method, we believe that the indicators of translation accuracy can reduce inaccurate judgments. In addition, the percentage indicator can compensate for the shortcomings of the five-point scale. In other words, we believe that users may judge translation accuracy more easily by using a combination of these indicators. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","back translation; machine translation; multilingual communication","Automatic evaluation; back translation; machine translation; Machine translations; Multilingual communications; Automatic evaluation; Back translations; Machine translations; Multilingual communications; Information theory; Knowledge management; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Repair; Human computer interaction; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960334334

Rising costs of language translation by professional translators are inhibiting the growth of global delivery of services from and to countries and geographies where most documents need to be translated. The quality levels of current machine translation engines are inadequate for such business processes, since translation errors may cause significant business problems. Human-quality translations are needed, and we need tools for enhancing these human translation efforts. We have developed an architecture and some tools to help people create translations more efficiently. The framework provides tools for interactively creating translations by aggregating the information necessary for translating the documents, for checking the quality of the source documents to be translated, and for effectively gathering translation-related resources from existing documents. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of the tools, and confirmed that the framework and tools are valuable in assisting human translation work. © 2011 IEEE.","Machine translation; Translation assistance","Business performance; Business problems; Business Process; Global resources; Language translation; Machine translations; Productivity improvements; Quality levels; Equipment; Information theory; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051934666

Post-editing of no matches appears to work on engines trained with specific bilingual data on a source written under controlled language constraints. Would this, however, work for any type of task as Google's advice implies? We have tested this by carrying out experiments with English-Chinese trainees, using the Toolkit to translate from the source text (the control group) and by post-editing (the experimental group).Results showthat post-editing gains in productivity aremarginal. With regard to quality, however, post-editing produces significantly better statistical results compared to translating manually. These gains in quality are observed independently of language direction, text difficulty or translator's level of performance. In light of these findings, we discuss whether translators should consider post-editing as a viable alternative to conventional translation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Google Translator Toolkit; Machine translation; Non-professional translation; Post-editing; Translation memory; Translation training","Control groups; Experimental groups; Machine translation; Machine translations; Post-editing; Source text; Translation memories; Translation memory; Translator toolkit; Information theory; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855705714

This technique is so called the general-purpose computation on graphic processing units (GPGPUs). Recent research on accelerating various applications by GPGPUs using a programming model from NVIDIA, called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), have shown significant improvement on performance results. However, writing an efficient CUDA program requires in-depth understanding of GPU architecture in order to develop a suitable data-parallel strategy, and to express it in a low-level style of code. Thus, CUDA programming is still considered complex and error-prone. This paper proposes a new set of application program interfaces (APIs), called Griffon, and its compiler framework for automatic translation of C programs to CUDA-based programs. The Griffon APIs allow programmers to exploit the performance of multicore machines using OpenMP and offloads computations to GPUs using Griffon directives. The Griffon compiler framework uses a new graph algorithm for efficiently exploiting data locality. Experimental results on a 16-core NVIDIA Geforce 8400M GS using four workloads show that Griffon-based programs can accelerate up to 89 times faster than their sequential implementation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Accelerating Computing; Automatic translation; CUDA; GPU; Parallel Programming","Accelerating Computing; Application program interfaces; Automatic translation; C programs; Compute unified device architectures; CUDA; Data locality; Data parallel; Error prones; General-purpose computing; GPU; Graph algorithms; Graphic processing units; Graphical processing units; In-depth understanding; Multi-core machines; Programming models; Sequential implementation; Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; C (programming language); Computer graphics equipment; Distributed computer systems; Parallel architectures; Parallel programming; Program translators; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052974536

Consequently, the opportunities for communication amongst people whose native languages differ are increasing. In healthcare facilities, a paper-based multilingual interview sheet is used to facilitate communication between medical workers and foreign patients. However, this interview sheet has been found to be inadequate for such purposes. Moreover, Japanese medical workers find it difficult to understand the different languages written on a paper-based interview sheet. To resolve this problem, we have developed a multilingual interview-sheet composition system that uses parallel texts and machine translation. This system can convey essential patient information to a medical worker during consultation. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) We have proposed a multilingual interview-sheet composition system that can be used for communication between medical workers and foreign patients. We have developed this system using both parallel texts and machine translation. (2) We showed that a patient is able to create a multilingual interview sheet using a parallel corpus and machine translation.

In some cases, these words that create a MWE are written together as a single (compound) word, however sometimes these words are written separately as completely different words (non-compound) each other.

In this study, we introduce an improved ranking mechanism that dynamically learns from user feedback.

However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state-of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrase-based model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest.

In this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. Since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. In this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. In particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches.

Most work has used a parser in the source language along with rules to map the source language word order into the target language word order. The requirement to have a source language parser is a major drawback, which we seek to overcome in this paper. Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with high-quality word alignments. Our model learns pairwise costs of a word immediately preceding another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For English to Hindi we show that our technique achieves better performance than a method that uses rules applied to the source side English parse. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"High quality; Lin-Kernighan; Machine translations; Parallel corpora; Performance based; Public dataset; Source language; Statistical machine translation; Target language; Training and testing; Word alignment; Word orders; Word reordering; Computational linguistics; Information theory; Natural language processing systems; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053252077

It has long been the hope that by tuning machine translation systems against these new generation metrics, advances in automatic machine translation evaluation can lead directly to advances in automatic machine translation. However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-the-art machine translation system over its BLEU-tuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better human-judged translation quality than the BLEU-tuned baseline.

To generate high quality translations, however, MT decoders can be highly computation intensive. With significant raw computing power, multi-core microprocessors have the potential to speed up MT software on desktop machines. However, retrofitting existing MT decoders is a nontrivial issue. Race conditions and atomicity issues are among those complications making parallelization difficult. In this article, we show that, to parallelize a state-of-the-art MT decoder, it is much easier to overcome such difficulties by using a process-based parallelization method, called functional task parallelism, than using conventional thread-based methods. We achieve a 7.60 times speed up on an 8-core desktop machine while making significantly less changes to the original sequential code than required by using multiple threads. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Computing power; High quality; Machine translations; Multi core; Multiple threads; Parallelizations; Parallelizing; Software vendors; Task parallelism; Information theory; Retrofitting; Decoding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053410933

Hence, it will be a great advantage for the people to have reliable machine translation. The expectation from the Machine Translation (MT) is sentences translation in a natural way based on the contexts. There are some reasons of why MT is hard to develop. One of the cause is there exists many mapping from source to target words in one-to-many, many-to-one, and manyto- many. For example, an English preposition can have more than one translation in Indonesian words depend on the context. This research tries to find a technique that can provide a suitable translation of the English prepositions to the Indonesian words. The technique will use LG formalism and statistical method. The meaning of preposition in a sentence depends on the preceding word and the following word. The word before the preposition is a word explained by the preposition. Meanwhile, the word after a preposition is a word that explains the preposition. Knowing that both preceding and following words are not always precisely in the right and left positions of the preposition, we then need a method to find those connected words. We try to handle the problem by using LG formalism. LG formalism consists of a set of words and each word has a linking requirement. Using this linking requirement, the words that have a link to the preposition can be resolved. After obtaining the connected words, the translation is done using statistical method. Statistical method translates the preposition based on the probability of the relation which is obtained from LG formalism. This work expresses its relation in the bigram form. If an English preposition bigram has more than one Indonesian translation, then the output is the bigram that have the biggest probability. In this research, the combination between LG formalism and statistical method give a better English preposition translation than the existing methods. © 2011 IEEE.","LG formalism; preposition; statistical method","English languages; LG formalism; Link grammar; Machine translations; Many-to-one; preposition; Prepositional phrase; Right and left; Electrical engineering; Information theory; Statistics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054021427

However, original SVM (C-SVM) only focuses on the scatter between classes, but neglects the global information about the data which are also vital for an optimal classifier. Therefore, C-SVM loses some robustness. To solve this problem, one approach is to translate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplane according to the global characteristics of the data. However, parts of existing work using this approach are based on specific distribution assumption (S-SVM), while the rest fail to utilize the global information (GS-SVM). In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient method based on weighted scatter degree (WSD-SVM) to embed the global information into GS-SVM without any distribution assumptions.

We present a novel way that uses cross-validation to automatically judge the human corrections where each MT output is corrected by more than one annotator. Cross-validation among corrections for the same machine translation, and among corrections from the same annotator are both applied. We get a correlation around 40% in sentence quality for Chinese-English and Spanish-English. We also evaluate the user quality as well.

The algorithm based on morphological rules related to Sana'ani dialect as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Such rules facilitate the dialect conversion to its corresponding MSA. The algorithm tokenizes the input dialect text and analyses each token into stem and its affixes; such affixes can be categorized into two categories: dialect affixes and/or MSA affixes. At the same time, the stem could be dialect stem or MSA stem. Therefore, our algorithm must pay attention to such situations. That is done by using of a simple MSA stemmer. Then our dialect stemmer is applied to strip the resulting token and extract dialect affixes. At this point, the rules take place to decide when to carry out the extraction of an affix. The experiment shows that Sana'ani dialect has three classes of distortions. They are prefixes, suffixes, and stems distortions. The algorithm normalizes such distortion based on the morphological rules. For each morphological rule the algorithm checks possibility of applying such rule. That means if rule conditions meet, then the dialect affix will be replaced by its MSA correspondence. If there is no restriction on applying the rule related to the distorted stem, then the rule can be considered as a parallel corpus of dialect and MSA. Finally, the experiment computes the distortion ratio of MSA in Sana'ani dialect. For Sana'ani dialect sample of 529 words, 6.98% of them have distorted suffixes, 5.65% have distorted prefixes and 11.72% contain distorted stems. These percentages are related to processed words only.","Modern standard Arabic; MSA; NLP; Rule-based machine translation; Sana'a dialect; Yemeni","Machine translations; Modern standards; MSA; NLP; Sana'a dialect; Yemeni; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided language translation; Experiments; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866098372

In this work, we propose a crawling strategy that locates bilingualWeb sites by constraining the visitation policy of the crawler to the graph neighborhood of bilingual sites on the Web. Subsequently, we use a novel recursive mining technique that recursively extracts text and links from the collection of bilingual Web sites obtained from the crawling. Our method does not suffer from the computationally prohibitive combinatorial matching typically used in previous work that uses document retrieval techniques to match a collection of bilingual webpages. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in the context of machine translation in the tourism and hospitality domain.

There are three main processes to build a grammar checker: checking the sentence patterns in chunk level, analyzing the chunk errors and correcting the errors. According to experimental results, this checker can detect simple, compound and complex sentence types for declarative and interrogative sentences. This system is useful for reducing grammar errors of target language in Myanmar-English machine translation system.","Rule based model; Statistical machine translation system; Trigram language model","Complex sentences; English sentences; Grammar checkers; Grammatical relations; Language model; Machine translation systems; Main process; Rule-based models; Statistical machine translation system; Target language; Tri grams; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Context free grammars; Errors; Model checking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863868382

For existing MT systems, especially Statistic based MT(SBMT), the issue of multiword expressions (MWEs) detection and accurate correspondence from source to target language remains an unsolved problem. Template or Super Function based machine translation system suffer less from the existance of MWEs, but MWEs are still main holdback of MT systems. Our initial experiments on the Chinese-Japanese MT systems reveal that, where MWEs exist, SFBMT system suffer in terms of both efficiency ,comprehensibility and adequacy of finding the translation functions. Statistic based Machine Translation suffers more than SFBMT. For SFBMT systems to become of further practical use, they need to be enhanced with MWEs processing capability. As part of our study towards this goal, we proposed a discriminative latent model, which was developed for sequence labeling task, for identifying and extracting Chinese MWEs. In our evaluation, the tool achieved precisions ranging from 71.46% to 95.87% for different types of MWEs. Such results demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically identify many Chinese MWEs using our tool, Super Function based MT will be further improvement after the Chinese MWEs have been detected. © 2011 IEEE.","Discriminative Model; Global Feature; Machine Translation; Multiword Expression Extraction; Super Function","Discriminative models; Global feature; Machine translations; Multiword expressions; Super-Function; Computational linguistics; Knowledge engineering; Natural language processing systems; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863183235

Our experiments in a Chinese-English translation task show that, selecting only 50% of the whole corpus via the graph-based selection approach as training set, we can obtain the near translation result with the one using the whole corpus, and we obtain better results than the baselines after using the IDF-related ranking approach. © 2011 IEEE.","Corpus selection; Graph; Ranking; SMT","Bilingual corpora; Corpus selection; Graph; Graph-based; Ranking; Ranking approach; Selection framework; Space complexity; Statistical machine translation; Training sets; Translation systems; Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Surface mount technology; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862914493

Yet, freely available MT engines (i.e. Google Translate) and MT-related web initiatives (i.e. Gabble-on.com) position themselves to cater precisely to the needs of learners with a limited command of a second language (L2). Anecdotal classroom evidence points to beginners availing themselves of MT help, even against the advice of teachers. In order to find out whether MT could help develop learners' writing skills in L2, we ran some tests asking participants to write directly into L2 in one instance and into L1 in another, while pre-editing the L1 and post-editing the L2 within the MT's Tradukka.com interface. Analysis of the output produced has found that MT helps beginners to communicate more, particularly when they had a lesser mastery of the language. The less their mastery of the L2, the greater the difference between the number of words composed with the help of MT and the number of those written directly into L2. It also helped them to communicate better, with blind marking indicating higher quality when writing with MT mediation. Looking at the screen recordings, on the other hand, we found that writing directly into L2 requires more effort, as measured by number of pauses, and involves more engagement with the task, as measured by the number of editing interventions. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","computer-assisted language learning; computer-assisted translation; foreign language teaching and learning; machine translation; second language acquisition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858848467

This approach provides structure to an otherwise monotonous sequence of nucleotides. However, one of the major differences between DNA sequences and text is in how semantic units (e.g. words) are distinguished within them. Whereas words and sentences are separated by spaces and punctuation in natural languages, no such markers exist in DNA. Some semantic units in DNA (e.g. genes) can be identified relatively easily and with relatively high accuracy. Other units may have less known molecular mechanisms and are therefore harder to identify accurately. In this paper we discuss three machine learning methods to elucidate the boundaries of such difficult units: heuristic approaches use hypothesized models of the mechanism to identify word boundaries, supervised machine learning methods generalise labelled examples of word boundaries to a model that can be used to detect these boundaries, and unsupervised machine learning methods infer a model from unlabeled data. As an example, we use a bacterial transposable element called ISEcp1 that moves DNA segments of variable length. We assess the accuracy of each of the above methods using rediscovery experiments. We demonstrate the power of the methods by examining 9 instances of DNA segments associated with ISEcp1 that lack known boundaries. We identified 6 units that include genes that confer resistance to clinically important antibiotics. © 2011 ACM.","antibioitc resistance; DNA languages; machine learning; translational bioinformatics","Cell functions; DNA languages; DNA segments; Heuristic approach; Molecular mechanism; Natural languages; Semantic units; Supervised machine learning; Systems biology; Three machine learning methods; Transposable elements; Unlabeled data; Unsupervised machine learning; Variable length; Bioinformatics; Communication; Genes; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Semantics; DNA",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856703816

In our previous study, we proposed Virtual Machine Aware journaling (VMA journaling), a file system journaling approach for virtual server environments. With reliable VMM and hardware subsystems, VMA journaling eliminates journal writes while ensuring file system consistency and data integrity in virtual server environments, allowing it to be an effective alternative to traditional journaling approaches in these environments. In recent years, solid-state disks (SSDs) have shown their potential as a replacement of traditional magnetic disks in commercial servers. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of VMA journaling on SSDs. We compare the performance of VMA journaling and three traditional journaling approaches (i.e., the three journaling modes of the ext3 journaling file system) in terms of lifetime and garbage collection overhead, which are two key performance metrics for SSDs. Since a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) is used in an SSD to emulate traditional disk interface and the SSD performance highly depends on the FTL being used, three state-of-the-art FTLs (i.e., FAST, SuperBlock FTL and DFTL) are implemented for performance evaluation. The performance results show that, traditional full data journaling could reduce the lifetime of the SSD significantly. VMA journaling extends the SSD lifetime under full data journaling by up to 86.5%. Moreover, GC overhead is reduced by up to 80.6% when compared to the full data journaling approach of ext3. Finally, VMA journaling is effective under all the FTLs. These results demonstrate that VMA journaling is effective in SSD-based virtual server environments. © 2011 IEEE.","Flash translation layer; Journaling file system; Virtual machine","Data integrity; Disk interface; File systems; Flash translation layer; Garbage collection; Hardware subsystem; Journaling modes; Magnetic disk; Performance evaluation; Performance metrics; Virtual machines; Virtual servers; Virtualizations; Computer simulation; Computer systems; Cost reduction; Refuse collection; Data reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856606717

In this paper, we report on a study investigating the effects of introducing a machine translation mediated BBS that enables monolinguals to collaboratively translate Wikipedia articles using their mother tongues. From our experiment using this system, we found out that users made high use of the system and communicated actively across different languages. Furthermore, most of such multilingual discussions seemed to be successful in transferring knowledge between different languages. Such success appeared to be made possible by a distinctive communication pattern which emerged as the users tried to avoid misunderstandings from machine translation errors.

Back-translation is used to check the accuracy of a sentence translated to a native language. For back-translation to be used as a method for checking the accuracy of a translated sentence, it has to satisfy the following conditions: There must be a positive correlation between the accuracy of sentences translated to an intermediate language and that of back-translated sentences, and there can be no significant difference between them. From the results of our verification, we found that back-translation satisfies these conditions. However, we found that accuracy mismatch case 1, which means that a back-translated sentence is accurate but the translated sentence is inaccurate, occurred although the number of such accuracy mismatch cases was small. Accuracy mismatch case 1 can lead to serious problems in communication. In this paper, we discuss the causes of accuracy mismatch case 1.

The main contribution of this paper is that users can get MT evaluation reliability in the absence of reference translations, which greatly improving the utility of MT evaluation metrics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","automatic evaluation; machine translation evaluation; without reference translations","Automatic evaluation; Automatic machines; Evaluation Method; Machine translation evaluations; Machine translations; MT evaluations; N-grams; Relative errors; Research issues; Source language; Target language; Computational linguistics; Information theory; Intelligent systems; Knowledge engineering; Probability; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555208750

Functional characterization of these genomes, such as by high-throughput proteomics, is an important but challenging task due to the difficulty of scaling up existing experimental techniques. By use of comparative genomics techniques, experimental results can be transferred from one genome to another, while at the same time minimizing errors by requiring discovery in multiple genomes. In this study, protein phosphorylation, an essential component of many cellular processes, is studied using data from large-scale proteomics analyses of the phosphoproteome. Phosphorylation sites from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster phosphopeptide data sets were mapped onto conserved domains in NCBI's manually curated portion of Conserved Domain Database (CDD). In this subset, 25 phosphorylation sites are found to be evolutionarily conserved between the three species studied. Transfer of phosphorylation annotation of these conserved sites onto sequences sharing the same conserved domains yield 3253 phosphosite annotations for proteins from coelomata, the taxonomic division that spans H. sapiens, M. musculus and D. melanogaster. The method scales automatically, so as the amount of experimental phosphoproteomics data increases, more conserved phosphorylation sites may be revealed. © The Author(s) 2011.",,"Coelomata; Drosophila melanogaster; Homo sapiens; Mus musculus; protein; algorithm; amino acid sequence; animal; article; automation; chemistry; genetics; genome; human; metabolism; methodology; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; protein processing; protein tertiary structure; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Automation; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Genome; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052327909

Unlike other IMT implementations where user feedback is used only to improve the predictions of the system, our IMT implementation takes advantage of user feedback to update the statistical models involved in the translation process. We introduce a sentence sampling strategy to select the sentences that are worth to be interactively translated, and a retraining method to update the statistical models with the user-validated translations. Both, the sampling strategy and the retraining process are designed to work in real-time to meet the severe time constraints inherent to the IMT framework. Experiments in a simulated setting showed that the use of AL dramatically reduces user effort required to obtain translations of a given quality. © 2011 ACM.","active learning; interactive machine translation","Active Learning; Experimental studies; interactive machine translation; Machine translations; Sampling strategies; Statistical models; Time constraints; Translation process; User feedback; Interactive computer systems; Sampling; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455242886

In this paper we verify this hypothesis on French-English translation data, and explore the utility of compiling adjunct-poor data for augmenting the training data of a phrase-based machine translation model. © 2012 European Association for Machine Translation.",,"Computational linguistics; Linguistics; French-english; Linguistic knowledge; Machine translations; Parallel corpora; Phrase-based machine translations; Phrase-based statistical machine translation; Training data; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001103567

In practice, CLIR systems are typically evaluated by judging result relevance in the document language, to factor out the effects of translating the results using machine translation (MT). In this paper, we investigate the influence of four different approaches for integrating MT and CLIR on both retrieval accuracy and user judgment of relevancy. We create a corpus with relevance judgments for both human and machine translated results, and use it to quantify the effect that MT quality has on end-to-end relevance. We find that MT errors result in a 16-39% decrease in mean average precision over the ground truth system that uses human translations. MT errors also caused relevant sentences to appear irrelevant - 5-19% of sentences were relevant in human translation, but were judged irrelevant in MT. To counter this degradation, we present two hybrid retrieval models and two automatic MT post-editing techniques and show that these approaches substantially mitigate the errors and improve the end-to-end relevance.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Errors; Information retrieval; Search engines; Cross-lingual information retrieval; Document languages; Ground truth; Machine translations; Post-editing; Relevance judgment; Retrieval accuracy; Retrieval models; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992390112

Furthermore, we incorporate word semantic orientation extracted from the English lexical resource SentiWordNet as an additional feature. Since SentiWordNet is an English resource, lexical entries in the studied French corpus should be translated into English. For this purpose, we propose a number of French to English translation experiments such as machine translation and WordNet synset translation using EuroWordNet. Obtained results show that WordNet synset translation have not significantly improved the classification performance with respect to the bag of words baseline due to the shortage in coverage.

One important type of contextual information concerns who or what a coreferring pronoun corefers to (i.e., its antecedent). Languages differ significantly in how they achieve coreference, and awareness of antecedents is important in choosing the correct pronoun. Disregarding a pronoun's antecedent in translation can lead to inappropriate coreferring forms in the target text, seriously degrading a reader's ability to understand it. This work assesses the extent to which source-language annotation of coreferring pronouns can improve English-Czech Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).

One issue with structured problems in general is the difficulty in obtaining fully structured labels, e.g., in machine translation, obtaining reference translations or parallel sentence corpora for arbitrary language pairs. Another issue, more specific to the translation domain, is the difficulty in online training of machine translation systems, since existing methods often require bilingual knowledge to correct translation output online. We propose a solution to these two problems, by demonstrating a way to incorporate binary-labeled feedback (i.e., feedback on whether a translation hypothesis is a ""good"" or understandable one or not), a form of supervision that can be easily integrated in an online manner, into a machine translation framework.

The method uses sentences which consist of Mongolian words associated with affix sequences to establish a Hidden Markov Model. We identify Mongolian affix in a given word based on this model. When a morpheme is identified as the affix, we can get the stem easily according to Mongolian word and affix. The segmentation error is corrected by applying the vocabulary model of words and affixes, the 1-gram model of affixes and the reverse maximum matching model. In order to further validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method, we use morphemes as pivot language in a chained machine translation system.

In many situations, text to be translated constitutes an unbounded stream of data that grows continually with time. An effective approach to translate text documents is to follow an interactive-predictive paradigm in which both the system is guided by the user and the user is assisted by the system to generate error-free translations. Unfortunately, when processing such unbounded data streams even this approach requires an overwhelming amount of manpower. Is in this scenario where the use of active learning techniques is compelling. In this work, we propose different active learning techniques for interactive machine translation. Results show that for a given translation quality the use of active learning allows us to greatly reduce the human effort required to translate the sentences in the stream. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Active Learning; Data stream; Effective approaches; Machine translations; Text document; Translation quality; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891631903

This is achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities that vocabulary overlap and similarities between the languages X1 and X2 in spelling, word order, and syntax offer: (1) we improve the word alignments for the resource-poor language, (2) we further augment it with additional translation options, and (3) we take care of potential spelling differences through appropriate transliteration.

Due to lack of linguistic community, there are no wide works accomplished in Sanskrit translation while it is national language by virtue of its importance in India's cultural heritage. This paper describes a rule-based approach of machine translation which translates an English sentence (source language sentence) into equivalent Sanskrit sentence (target language sentence). Due to morphological richness of Sanskrit language, this system makes limited use of syntax and uses only morphological markings to identify subject, object, verb, preposition, adjective and adverb, as well as conjunctive sentences. It uses limited parsing for part of speech (POS) tagging, identification of clause, its subject, object, verb, etc and gender-number-person (GNP) of noun and object. This system gives translation result in GUI form and handles English sentences of different classes. The performance evaluations of our EST system with different methods of MT evaluations are shown using table and column chart.

However, during this sequential process, errors may propagate from the word alignment step through the translation probability calculation step. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating phrase translation probabilities that reduce the effects of error propagation. By considering the semantic recoverability of phrase retranslation, our method identifies incorrect phrase pairs that have propagated from alignment errors. Furthermore, we define retranslation similarity which represents the semantic recoverability of phrase retranslation, and use this when computing translation probabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed phrase translation estimation method effectively prevents a PBSMT system from selecting incorrect phrase pairs, and consistently improves the translation quality in various language pairs.

Linguistic guidelines for the target language are required, and human evaluators use them in to classify the output errors. The experiments are performed on English-to-Catalan and Spanish-to-Catalan translation outputs generated by four different systems: 2 rule-based and 2 statistical. All translations are evaluated using the 3 following methods: a standard human perceptual evaluation method, several widely used automatic metrics, and the human linguistic evaluation. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the linguistic, perceptual, and automatic results are then calculated, showing that the semantic level correlates significantly with both perceptual evaluation and automatic metrics. © 2011 ASIS&T.",,"Automatic machines; Automatic metrics; Correlation analysis; Evaluation Method; Human evaluation; Machine translations; Objective evaluation; Output errors; Perceptual evaluation; Rule based; Semantic levels; Spearman correlation; Target language; Errors; Information theory; Linguistics; Semantics; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83655201280

The translation of scientific text is still limited in accuracy due to the fact that the scientific terms cannot be translated appropriately. Word order rules are very important for the generation of sentences in the target language whereas the word order in Arabic language is different from the order in English. Any Arabic Machine Translation (MT) system to English should be able to deal with word order. Approach: The aim of this study is to introduces-MT (Verbal Sentence rule based Machine Translation), an automatic system for Arabic verbal sentence of scientific text to English translation using transfer based approach. Verbal sentences constitute the majority of Arabic scientific document. The system involves three phases: analysis, transfer and generation phase. The transfer method is one of the rule based approach category and the most common technique used in machine translation system. Results: The system was trained on 45 verbal sentences from different Arabic scientific text and tested on 30 new verbal sentences from different domain. An experiment performed involves comparison with two other machine translation systems namely Syzran and Google. The accuracy of the result of the designed system is 93%. Conclusion: VS-MT has been successfully implemented and tested on many verbal sentences from different field of Arabic thesis. An experiment was performed which involves comparison with two other machine translation systems namely Syzran and Google.

This technique is so called the generalpurpose computation on graphic processing units (GPGPUs). Recent research on accelerating various applications by GPGPUs using a programming model from NVIDIA, called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), have shown significant improvement on performance results. However, writing an efficient CUDA program requires in-depth understanding of GPU architecture in order to develop a suitable data-parallel strategy, and to express it in a low-level style of code. Thus, CUDA programming is still considered complex and error-prone. This paper proposes a new set of application program interfaces (APIs), called Griffon, and its compiler framework for automatic translation of C programs to CUDA-based programs. Griffon APIs allow programmers to exploit the performance of multicore machines using OpenMP and offloads computations to GPUs using Griffon directives. The compiler framework uses a new graph algorithm for efficiently exploiting data locality. Experimental results on a 16-core NVIDIA Geforce 8400M GS using six workloads show that Griffon-based programs can accelerate from 1.5 up to 89 times faster than their sequential implementation running on CPU. © 2012 by IJAI (CESER Publications).","Accelerating Computing; Automatic translation; CUDA; GPU; Parallel Programming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863606046

This challenge is magnified when translating into a morphologically rich language. In this work we address this challenge in the framework of a broad-coverage English-to-Arabic phrase based statistical machine translation (PBSMT). We explore the largest-to-date set of Arabic segmentation schemes ranging from full word form to fully segmented forms and examine the effects on system performance. Our results show a difference of 2.31 BLEU points averaged over all test sets between the best and worst segmentation schemes indicating that the choice of the segmentation scheme has a significant effect on the performance of an English-to-Arabic PBSMT system in a large data scenario. We show that a simple segmentation scheme can perform as well as the best and more complicated segmentation scheme. An in-depth analysis on the effect of segmentation choices on the components of a PBSMT system reveals that text fragmentation has a negative effect on the perplexity of the language models and that aggressive segmentation can significantly increase the size of the phrase table and the uncertainty in choosing the candidate translation phrases during decoding. An investigation conducted on the output of the different systems, reveals the complementary nature of the output and the great potential in combining them. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arabic detokenization; Arabic machine translation; Arabic segmentation; English to Arabic translation","Arabic detokenization; In-depth analysis; Language model; Large data; Machine translations; Morphological segmentation; Phrase-based statistical machine translation; Segmentation scheme; Statistical machine translation; Test sets; Computational linguistics; Translation (languages); Uncertainty analysis; Information theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857793210

A number of previous efforts have tackled this tradeoff by starting with a commitment to linguistically motivated analyses and then finding appropriate ways to soften that commitment. We present an approach that explores the tradeoff from the other direction, starting with a translation model learned directly from aligned parallel text, and then adding soft constituent-level constraints based on parses of the source language. We argue that in order for these constraints to improve translation, they must be fine-grained: the constraints should vary by constituent type, and by the type of match or mismatch with the parse. We also use a different feature weight optimization technique, capable of handling large amount of features, thus eliminating the bottleneck of feature selection.

Focusing on the most time-consuming part of the NuFFT computation, the data translation step, in this paper, we develop an automatic parallel code generation tool for data translation targeting emerging multicores. The key components of this tool are two scalable parallelization strategies, namely, the source-driven parallelization and the target-driven parallelization. Both these strategies employ equally sized geometric tiling and binning to improve data locality while trying to balance workloads across the cores through dynamic task allocation. They differ in the partitioning and scheduling schemes used to guarantee mutual exclusion in data updates. This tool also consists of a code generator and a code optimizer for the data translation. We evaluated our tool on a commercial multicore machine for both 2D and 3D inputs under different sample distributions with large data set sizes. The results indicate that both parallelization strategies have good scalability as the number of cores and the number of dimensions of data space increase. In particular, the target-driven parallelization outperforms the other when samples are nonuniformly distributed. The experiments also show that our code optimizations can bring about 32%43% performance improvement to the data translation step of NuFFT. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","automatic parallelization; code generation; convolution; data translation; Nonuniform FFT","Automatic Parallelization; Code Generation; Code generators; Code optimization; Data locality; Data space; Data translations; Data update; Dynamic task allocation; Large data; Multi-core machines; Multi-cores; Mutual exclusions; Nonuniform; Optimizers; Parallel code; Parallelization strategies; Parallelizations; Performance improvements; Sample distributions; Scheduling schemes; Time-consuming parts; Automatic programming; Convolution; Fast Fourier transforms; Network components; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862159436

Design/methodology/approach - Randomly selected metadata records were translated from English into Chinese using Google, Bing, and SYSTRAN MT systems. These translations were then evaluated using a five point scale for both fluency and adequacy. Missing count (words not translated) and incorrect count (words incorrectly translated) were also recorded. Findings - Concerning both fluency and adequacy, Google and Bing's translations of more than 70 percent of test data received scores equal to or greater than three, representative of ""non-native Chinese"" and ""much coverage,"" respectively. SYSTRAN scored lowest in both measures. However, these differences were not statistically significant. A Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a strong relationship (r - 0.86) between fluency and adequacy. Missing count and incorrect count strongly correlated with fluency and adequacy. Originality/value - Most existing digital collections can be accessed in English alone. Few digital collections in the USA support multilingual information access (MLIA) that enables users of differing languages to search, browse, recognize and use information in the collections. Human translation is one solution, but it is neither time nor cost effective for most libraries. This study serves as a first step to understand the performance of current MT systems and to design effective and efficient MLIA services for digital collections. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-language information retrieval; Digital libraries; Globalization; Machine translation; Multilingual information access",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859362291

The problem here is how to extract parallel sentence pairs automatically but accurately from comparable non-parallel corpora, which are usually very ""noisy"". This paper presents how we can apply the reinforcement-learning scheme with our new proposed algorithm for detecting parallel sentence pairs.

The key idea is that a Statistical Machine Translation package can be used for the Cross-Language Retrieval Task of assembling a training set from a vast amount of available text (e.g. a large multilingual corpus, or the Web) and then train on that data, repeating the process several times. The stability issues related to such a feedback loop are addressed by a mathematical model, connecting statistical and control-theoretic aspects of the system. We test it on controlled environment and real-world tasks, showing that indeed this agent can improve its translation performance autonomously and in a stable fashion, when seeded with a very small initial training set. We develop a multiprocessor version of the agent that directly accesses the Web using a Web search engine and taking advantage of the big amount of data available there. The modelling approach we develop for this agent is general, and we believe that it will be useful for an entire class of self-learning autonomous agents working on the Web. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Concretely, our approach leverages a family of languages closely related to the speaker's native language to construct translations in a coherent mix of these languages. Experimental results indicate that these translations can be easily understood, being also a useful aid for users who are not proficient in foreign languages. Therefore this work significantly contributes to HCI in two ways: it establishes a language that can improve how applications communicate to their users, and it reports insights on the user acceptance towards the method.

It is also influenced by protein-specific properties, such as a protein's structural make-up and interaction partners. New experimental techniques coupled with powerful data integration methods now enable us to not only investigate what features govern protein stability in general, but also to build models that identify what properties determine each protein's metabolic stability.Results: In this work we present five groups of features useful for predicting protein stability: (1) post-translational modifications, (2) domain types, (3) structural disorder, (4) the identity of a protein's N-terminal residue and (5) amino acid sequence. We incorporate these features into a predictive model with promising accuracy. At a 20% false positive rate, the model exhibits an 80% true positive rate, outperforming the only previously proposed stability predictor. We also investigate the impact of N-terminal protein tagging as used to generate the data set, in particular the impact it may have on the measurements for secreted and transmembrane proteins; we train and test our model on a subset of the data with those proteins removed, and show that the model sustains high accuracy. Finally, we estimate system-wide metabolic stability by surveying the whole human proteome.Conclusions: We describe a variety of protein features that are significantly over- or under-represented in stable and unstable proteins, including phosphorylation, acetylation and destabilizing N-terminal residues. Bayesian networks are ideal for combining these features into a predictive model with superior accuracy and transparency compared to the only other proposed stability predictor. Furthermore, our stability predictions of the human proteome will find application in the analysis of functionally related proteins, shedding new light on regulation by protein synthesis and degradation. © 2012 Patrick et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Bayesian networks; Degradation; Machine learning; Post-translational modifications; Prediction; Protein stability; Support vector machines","protein; article; chemistry; human; metabolism; methodology; protein stability; proteomics; Humans; Protein Stability; Proteins; Proteomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861951578

Such semantics are also executable when there exists a target platform able to execute the target models. Conceiving a transformation that targets a low-level language still remains arduous due to the large semantic gap between the DSL and the corresponding target language. In this respect, depending on the domain of the DSL, this task can be made easier by reusing an existing platform and bytecode language for that domain, as for instance the EMF Transformation Virtual Machine (EMFTVM) for the domain of model transformation. This paper defines executable semantics for EMFMigrate, a model transformation language specifically designed for managing the coupled evolution in model-driven development. To this end, the approach considers EMFTVM as the runtime engine targeted by the proposed semantic mappings. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Bytecode languages; Co-evolution; Coupled evolution; Domain specific languages; High-level models; Low-level language; Model driven development; Model to model transformation; Model transformation; Runtimes; Semantic gap; Semantic mapping; Specific languages; Target language; Target model; Virtual machines; Computer simulation; Problem oriented languages; Semantics; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862206101

This enables us to study the detailed evolutionary history of recent speciation and demographics. Sophisticated statistical methods are needed, however, to extract the information that DNA sequences hold, and a limiting factor in this is dealing with the large state space that the ancestry of large DNA sequences spans. Recently a new analysis method, CoalHMMs, has been developed, that makes it computationally feasible to scan full genome sequences - the complete genetic information of a species - and extract genetic histories from this. Applying this methodology, however, requires that the full state space of ancestral histories can be constructed. This is not feasible to do manually, but by applying formal methods such as Petri nets it is possible to build sophisticated evolutionary histories and automatically derive the analysis models needed.

Since both paradigms have been largely used during the last years, one of the aims in the research community is to know how these systems differ in terms of translation quality. To this end, this paper reports a study and comparison of several specific Catalan-Spanish machine translation systems: two rule-based and two corpus-based (particularly, statisticalbased) systems, all of them freely available on the web. The translation quality analysis is performed under two different domains: journalistic and medical. The systems are evaluated by using standard automatic measures, as well as by native human evaluators. In addition to these traditional evaluation procedures, this paper reports a novel linguistic evaluation, which provides information about the errors encountered at the orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic levels. Results show that while rule-based systems provide a better performance at orthographic and morphological levels, statistical systems tend to commit less semantic errors. Furthermore, results show all the evaluations performed are characterised by some degree of correlation, and human evaluators tend to be specially critical with semantic and syntactic errors.","Catalan; Rule-based machine translation; Spanish; Statistical machine translation","Catalans; Degree of correlations; Different domains; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Research communities; Rule based; Semantic errors; Spanish; Statistical machine translation; Statistical systems; Syntactic errors; Translation quality; Content based retrieval; Errors; Semantics; Knowledge based systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862586548

The vast majority record the pyromantic divinations of the royal house of the late Shang dynasty at the capital of Yin. OBI is the earliest and complete system ancient Chinese characters. It has very important research merit. With the development of computer and information technology, digitization processing of OBI becomes an important aspect in current digitization processing of ancient Chinese font. For information researchers, the study object is OBI sentences added punctuation marks by experts, but it is also a heavy and difficult work processing these sentences. In order to reduce the burden of OBI experts and the research difficulties in the OBI information processing, reusing and managing the existing OBI knowledge, an example-based machine translation (EBMT) method is proposed. The advantages of EBMT for OBI are analyzed, and an example library building method based on OBI-Chinese parallel corpus is introduced. Firstly, the basic construction steps of bilingual parallel corpus are analyzed. Secondly, the processes and key technologies of EBMT for OBI are studied. Finally, a machine translation system is developed to verify the proposed method.

Since the number of treebank tags is much smaller than the number of words, the tag sequence based reordering model is smaller and more accurate than the phrase based reordering model. Experiments were carried out on four types of models: the phrase model, the hierarchical phrase model, the POS tag encapsulated phrase(PTEP) model and the syntactic tag encapsulated phrase(STEP) model.

By doing so, there are some tasks in which online adaptation is needed in order to adapt the system to changing scenarios. In the present work, we perform an exhaustive comparison of four online learning algorithms when combined with two adaptation strategies for the task of online adaptation in statistical machine translation. Two of these algorithms are already well-known in the pattern recognition community, such as the perceptron and passive-aggressive algorithms, but here they are thoroughly analyzed for their applicability in the statistical machine translation task. In addition, we also compare them with two novel methods, i.e., Bayesian predictive adaptation and discriminative ridge regression. In statistical machine translation, the most successful approach is based on a log-linear approximation to a posteriori distribution. According to experimental results, adapting the scaling factors of this log-linear combination of models using discriminative ridge regression or Bayesian predictive adaptation yields the best performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The word may have many senses, selecting the most appropriate sense for an ambiguous word in a sentence is a central problem in Machine Translation. Because, each sense of a word in a source language sentence may generate different target language sentences. Knowledge and corpus based methods are usually applied for disambiguation task. In the present paper, we propose an algorithm to disambiguate Kannada polysemous words using association rules. We built Kannada corpora using web resources.

It is known that AraMorph produces a large number of morphological solutions, but little information to select the appropriate morphological solution for words in context. For this purpose, we start characterizing/describing all particles of the Arabic language, broken noun patterns, and most nominal and verbal sentence structures; next, we formulated dozens of rules associated with these descriptions and then programmed them in a simple and efficient manner to help deducing not only the appropriate solution but also both case and ending case marks. We divided the Arabic particles into groups according to their grammatical functions for extracting the exact and final morphological function of words. Appropriate contextual rules have been stated based on the above descriptions; after applying our contextual rules on the output produced by AraMorph, we obtained an improvement of about 6% in the number of correct words with an accurate morphological function. Our goal is to reduce the error rate to less than 5% in order to integrate this very fast and accurate morpho-syntactic analyzer into a system to translate Arabic written text into Arabic sign language; we believe that this will give enough information to achieve a quick and effective translation. © 2012 ACM.","Arabic morphology and syntax; automatic translation; broken plurals; contextual rules; particles; syntactic rules","Arabic morphology and syntax; Automatic translation; broken plurals; Contextual rules; Syntactic rules; Elementary particles; Information science; Syntactics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866098727

The Universal Networking Language or UNL facilitates translation between Natural Languages across the world. The paper focuses on the linguistic aspects of Malayalam required for the deconversion process. The case marking module handles the different UNL relations and their corresponding language features in Malayalam. A Morphological Generator takes care of generation of Malayalam words with the appropriate case endings and features, with respect to the cases and UNL attributes present in the UNL expression. The words are rearranged by the Syntax Planning Module to produce proper Natural Language sentences. These language dependent features for Malayalam have been successfully incorporated into a Deconverter Framework that handles English and Tamil currently. The Deconverter for Malayalam can currently produce simple Malayalam sentences and handle sentences with single clausal phrases also. It is being enhanced to handle more types of sentences. The present system is a small achievement towards attaining a complete translation facility for the Malayalam language. The following sections examine what has been implemented so far in the Deconverter and what more can be done to realize that dream of a translation facility. © 2012 ACM.","computational linguistics; machine translation; Malayalam; natural language processing; universal networking language; UNL","Machine translations; Malayalam; NAtural language processing; Universal networking languages; UNL; Computational linguistics; Information science; Natural language processing systems; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866061767

Machine translation and cross language information access are related technologies, and yet they have their own unique contributions in handling information in multiple languages. This paper aims to demonstrate that there are many opportunities to further integrate machine translation with cross language information access, and the combination can greatly empower web users in their information access. Design/methodology/approach: Using English and Chinese as the language pair for studying, this paper looks at machine translation in query translation-based cross language information access at multiple important aspects, which include query translation, relevance feedback, interactive cross language information access, out-of-vocabulary term translation, and data fusion. The goal is to obtain more insights about the wide range usages of machine translation in cross language information access, and to help the community to identify promising future directions for both machine translation and cross language access. Findings: Machine translation can be applied effectively in many places in the whole cross language information access process. Queries translated by a machine translation system are high quality and are more robust in handling potential untranslated terms. Translation enhancement, a relevance feedback method using machine translation generated returned documents, is not only a valid technique by itself, but also helps to generate more robust cross language information access performance when combined with other relevance feedback techniques. Machine translation is also found to play a significant role in resolving untranslated terms and in data fusion. Originality/value: This set of comparative empirical studies on integrating machine translation and cross language information access was performed on a common evaluation framework, and examined integration at multiple points of the cross language access process. The experimental results demonstrate the value of further integrating machine translation in cross language information access, and identify interesting future directions for both machine translation and cross language information access research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Information retrieval; Interactive retrieval; Languages; Machine translation; Multilingual information access; Query translation; Relevance feedback",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866862678

The pervasive use of preposition or its equivalent in most of the languages makes it a crucial element during translation. Unlike English, there is no concept of preposition in Kannada. English prepositions are translated to Kannada by attaching appropriate inflections to the head noun of the prepositional phrase. Further post-positional words may also appear in Kannada translation for some prepositions. The choice of the appropriate post-positional word depends on the WordNet synset information of the head noun. The paper proposes an algorithm to disambiguate sense of a simple preposition in English to Kannada MT. It uses properties of the head noun and complement of the preposition for disambiguation.

Machine translation technology is today available in the form of cross-language web services and can be embedded into multiuser and multilingual chats without disrupting the conversation flow. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of how real-time machine translation may affect communication in global software teams. In this paper, we present the replication of a controlled experiment that assesses the effect of real-time machine translation on multilingual teams while engaged in distributed requirements meetings. In particular, in this replication we specifically evaluate whether non-English speaking groups benefit from communicating in their own native languages when their English is not fluid enough for a fast-paced conversation.

Although virtual machine monitors (VMMs) had been around for decades, they were traditionally designed as part of monolithic, single-vendor architectures with explicit support for virtualization. In contrast, the x86 architecture lacked virtualization support, and the industry around it had disaggregated into an ecosystem, with different vendors controlling the computers, CPUs, peripherals, operating systems, and applications, none of them asking for virtualization. We chose to build our solution independently of these vendors. As a result, VMware Workstation had to deal with new challenges associated with (i) the lack of virtualization support in the x86 architecture, (ii) the daunting complexity of the architecture itself, (iii) the need to support a broad combination of peripherals, and (iv) the need to offer a simple user experience within existing environments. These new challenges led us to a novel combination of well-known virtualization techniques, techniques from other domains, and new techniques. VMware Workstation combined a hosted architecture with a VMM. The hosted architecture enabled a simple user experience and offered broad hardware compatibility. Rather than exposing I/O diversity to the virtual machines, VMware Workstation also relied on software emulation of I/O devices. The VMM combined a trap-and-emulate direct execution engine with a system-level dynamic binary translator to efficiently virtualize the x86 architecture and support most commodity operating systems. By relying on x86 hardware segmentation as a protection mechanism, the binary translator could execute translated code at near hardware speeds. The binary translator also relied on partial evaluation and adaptive retranslation to reduce the overall overheads of virtualization. Written with the benefit of hindsight, this article shares the key lessons we learned from building the original system and from its later evolution. © 2012 ACM.","Dynamic binary translation; Hypervisors; Virtual machine monitors; Virtualization; VMM; X86","Dynamic binary translation; Hypervisors; Virtual machine monitors; Virtualizations; VMM; X86; Computer hardware; Computer operating systems; Hardware; Program processors; Virtual reality; Computer architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870556673

In Chinese, as in Japanese, numerals quantify nouns along with appropriate measure words (classifiers); numerals cannot quantify nouns by themselves (especially in Chinese). Those numeral quantifiers often cause errors in Japanese-Chinese machine translation because of the wide variety of the Chinese classifiers and complicated correspondence between Japanese and Chinese classifiers. It depends on the quantified noun which classifier is appropriate. Accordingly, we devised a method for classifying the quantified nouns by their semantic attributes through comparative analysis of quantifiers in Chinese and Japanese sentences, and obtained translation rules for quantifiers that use the classification method. We conducted an experiment on the translation rules with our experimental Japanese-Chinese MT system and by manual using 600 sentences. The translation rules achieved an accuracy of 92.8%, which indicates their effectiveness. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chinese; classifier; counter word; Japanese; machine translation; measure word; quantifier","Chinese; counter word; Japanese; Machine translations; measure word; quantifier; Classifiers; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868155580

A statistical machine translation (SMT) system is applied to generate new sentences, given the sentences generated previously. For each line of sentence a specific model specially trained for that line is used, as opposed to using a single model for all sentences. To enhance the coherence of sentences on every line, a coherence model using mutual information is applied to select candidates with better consistency with previous sentences.

We observed the training corpus and list all possible features. The features include surface text, semantic and syntactical information, such as POS tagging, synonym substitution, and dependency relation.

In fact, as straightforward word-for-word Japanese-Uighur translation sometimes yields unnatural Uighur sentences. To raise the translation accuracy, we propose a word-for-word translation system using subject verb agreement in Uighur. After a brief introduction to the comparative study of Japanese-Uyghur grammars, morphology and syntax, we explain our developing of a word to word rule base system.

This translation method is that a compiler that translates C++ source programs to target codes has to be available for each platform. Reusability and portability of codes will also decrease because target codes have to be different for each platform they are run under. For that reason, much research is taking place in various fields in an effort to develop a retargetable compiler and a virtual machine that execute application programs without recompiling or modifying them though processor or operating systems are changed. We have developed the C++ compiler for the SVM(Smart Virtual Machine) of the smart platform on smart systems. As a part of the C++ compiler development, we designed the symbol table that can support object-oriented languages, C++ and java. The symbol table is a data structure to keep track of scope and binding information about names (or identifiers). Various information is entered into the symbol table after visiting and analyzing the abstract syntax tree generated by syntax-directed translation, and then is used to check whether the use of names is consistent with their definition during the semantic analysis phase and generate a valid code during the code generation phase. In this paper, we describe the reconstruction technique for verifying and analyzing the symbol table designed for the C++ compiler. This system reconstructs inputted C++ declarations by using information of the symbol table entered in the declaration process phase of the C++ compiler, and therefore we can verify completeness of symbol table design and correctness of information entered in the symbol table. In addition, this system also produces debug information, and so is effectively utilized for the development of the C++ compiler.","C++ compiler; Reverse translator; SVM(Smart Virtual Machine); Symbol table","Abstract Syntax Trees; Application programs; C++ compiler; Code Generation; Compiler development; Object-oriented languages; Recompiling; Reconstruction techniques; Retargetable compilers; Reverse translator; Semantic analysis; Smart platform; Smart System; Symbol table; Table design; Target codes; Translation method; Virtual machines; Computer simulation; Computer software; Data structures; Java programming language; Program debugging; Program translators; Reusability; Semantics; Program compilers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868701924

Furthermore, to use each of the game contents developed on the existing feature phone platform, they need to be recreated based on the smart phone platform. Consequently, large amounts of time and expenses are being used to analyze and convert the sources and resources of the mobile game contents for use on the smart phone platform. Rather than creating new game content, developers are investing twice the amount of time and money required to develop a game for one platform in making existing game content available on other platforms. In this paper, in order to resolve such problems the source translator of the automatic mobile game contents converter system will be implemented in order to convert the WIPI(Wireless Internet Platform for Interoperability) game contents for use on an Android smart platform. This system has enabled contents to be transferred into smart platforms within a short time, so that the time and money it takes to launch services for different mobile communication companies can be reduced. Furthermore, game contents developed for use on feature phones can also be converted and used on smart platforms to increase reusability of game contents and also new game contents creation processes can heighten productivity to consequently provide a more variety of game contents to users.","Android; Automatic mobile game contents converter; Mobile platform; Smart platform; Source translator; WIPI(Wireless Internet Platform for Interoperability); WIPI-to-android mobile game converter","Android; Mobile games; Mobile platform; Smart platform; Source translator; Wireless internet platform for interoperability; Interoperability; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Reusability; Robots; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Cellular telephone systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868681099

Traditionally, nearly all the related research work focus on obtaining the translation of the unknown words in different ways. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to handle unknown words in statistical machine translation. Instead of trying great effort to find the translation of unknown words, this paper focuses on determining the semantic function the unknown words serve as in the test sentence and keeping the semantic function unchanged in the translation process. In this way, unknown words will help the phrase reordering and lexical selection of their surrounding words even though they still remain untranslated. In order to determine the semantic function of each unknown word, this paper employs the distributional semantic model and the bidirectional language model.

A comparison between machine and human translation is conducted to illustrate one of their critical distinctions that human translators tend to use more cohesion devices than machine. Various ways to apply this feature to evaluate machine-translated documents are presented, including one without reliance on reference translation.

PTC problem is usually regarded as a sequence labeling problem, however, it is more difficult than any other general sequence labeling problems, since it requires a large label set of all Chinese characters for the labeling task. The essential difficulty of the task lies in the high degree of ambiguities of Chinese characters corresponding to Pinyins.

To assist the process, we present a novel translation model merging technique that allows rapid retraining of the translation models with incremental data.

Different from other reordering approaches, we handle the reordering at three levels: sentence level, chunk level, and word level. The chunk-level reordering is dependent on the sentence-level reordering, and the word-level reordering is dependent on the chunk-level reordering. In this paper, we formally describe the SCT model and discuss the translation strategy based on the SCT model. Further, we present an algorithm for analyzing the source language in SCT and transforming the source SCT into the target SCT.

We show a consistent improvement in terms of cross-entropy throughout the bootstrapping process, as well as promising decoding experiments using the learned grammars. Rather than relying on external resources such as parses, POS tags or dictionaries, our method is fully unsupervised (in the way this term is typically understood in the machine translation community). This means that the bootstrapping can only rely on information gathered during the previous step, which necessitates some strategy for expanding the expressiveness of the grammars. We present principled approaches for moving from finite-state to linear transduction grammars as well as from linear to inversion transduction grammars. It is our belief that early, integrated category formation and phrasal chunking in this unsupervised bootstrapping process is better aligned to child language acquisition.

Context-independent translation is performed using statistically-aligned tokens in parallel text, phrase-dependent translation is performed using aligned statistical phrases, and sentence-dependent translation is performed using those same aligned phrases together with an n-gram language model. Experiments on retrieval of Arabic, Chinese, and French documents using English queries show that no one technique is optimal for all queries, but that statistically significant improvements in mean average precision over strong baselines can be achieved by combining translation evidence from all three techniques. The optimal combination is, however, found to be resource-dependent, indicating a need for future work on robust tuning to the characteristics of individual collections. © 2012 The COLING.","Context; Cross-language information retrieval; Machine translation","Context; Cross language information retrieval; Internal representation; Machine translations; N-gram language models; Statistical machine translation system; Statistical translation; Statistical translation model; Information retrieval; Optimization; Computational linguistics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876807343

However, most of current statistical machine translation models do not model the semantics of sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel translation framework based on predicate-argument structure (PAS) for its capacity on grasping the semantics and skeleton structure of sentences. By using PAS, the framework effectively models both semantics of languages and global reordering for translation. In the framework, we divide the translation process into 3 steps: (1) PAS acquisition: perform semantic role labeling (SRL) on the input sentences to acquire source-side PASs; (2) Transformation: convert source-side PASs to their target counterparts by predicate-aware PAS transformation rules; (3) Translation: first translate the predicate and arguments of PAS and then adopt a CKY-style decoding algorithm to translate the entire PAS. Experimental results show that our PAS-based translation framework significantly improves the translation performance. © 2012 The COLING.","Pas transformation; Pasbased translation; Predicate-argument structure; Semantic role labeling","Decoding algorithm; Machine translations; Pas transformation; Predicateargument structures; Semantic role labeling; Statistical machine translation; Transformation rules; Translation process; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Semantics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876794790

We investigate different approaches to find similar sentences in an example base and evaluate their efficiency (runtime), effectiveness, and the resulting quality of translation output. A comparison of approaches demonstrates that i) a sequential computation of the edit distance between an input sentence and all sentences in the example base is not feasible, even when efficient algorithms to compute the edit distance are employed; ii) in-memory data structures such as tries and ternary search trees are more efficient in terms of runtime, but are not scalable for large example bases; iii) standard IR models which only cover material similarity (e.g. term overlap), do not perform well in finding the approximate matches, due to their lack of handling word order and word positions.

It is also partially due to PRO optimizing for a sentence-level score without a global view on the overall length, which introducing a bias towards short translations; we show that letting PRO optimize a corpus-level BLEU yields a perfect length.

Many researchers have contributed and developed quite good algorithms, frameworks and models for various languages. Processing of natural language involves various levels, complexities, ambiguities arise at each of those levels. Some pragmatic and semantic approaches can be used to tackle these issues. Generally, prepositions are plays sound role in meaningful translation for any languages. While translating from English to Tamil, preposition in English sentences should be translated to postposition to have meaningful sentences. Thus the prepositional phase errors and orthographic errors are the major issue in machine translation. The main goal of this paper is to improve the translation quality. To achieve the goal, we use some semantic rule to correct the prepositional and orthographic errors in this English-Tamil translation. The proposed approach takes as input an English sentence containing a preposition and the correct postposition and correct spelling in Tamil for that particular sentence context as output. The rules are evaluated with corpus data and the performance is good.

In general terms, we automatically translate each OCR hypothesis into another language, and then create a feature score based on how ""difficult"" it was to perform the translation.

Localization of modifications other than phosphorylation is also required but is less commonly supported by current tools. These other modifications, such as hydroxylation, may have broad aminoacid specificity, and can be misassigned when the correct specificity is not considered in an MS database search. In addition, localization software is often specific to a particular MS/MS search engine, and cannot be used to localize modifications identified by multiple search engines. ModLS, a new tool within our freely-available Central Proteomics Facilities Pipeline (CPFP), applies a localization scoring method to arbitrary post-translational modifications (PTMs). As well as localising PTMs based on amino-acid specificities are included in the initial search, ModLS can automatically consider additional specificities from UniMod. This can help avoid 'correct modification, incorrect amino-acid' errors which can occur when data is searched using only a subset of PTM specificities. Localization scoring can be performed on the results from any search engine incorporated within the pipeline, or where the output of individual search engines is combined to give increased coverage. We demonstrate the performance of ModLS using a publicly available phosphorylated peptide dataset, showing that it outperforms the recently characterized Mascot Delta Score approach for CID and MSA data, and is comparable for HCD data. In addition, we show the utility of automatic specificity expansion using hydroxylated and methylated peptide data. ModLS is a user-friendly localization tool for arbitrary modifications. Its inclusion within CPFP allows PTM localization to be performed quickly and easily on large or small result sets, from multiple search engines. Specificity expansion, introduced in ModLS, allows misassignments of modifications due to incomplete consideration of specificities to be identified and Minimized. © 2012 Trudgian DC, et al.","Algorithm; Localization; Open-source; Phosphorylation; Pipeline; PTM","algorithm; article; automatic specificity expansion; computer program; hydroxylation; information processing; mass spectrometry; posttranslational modification localization scoring; protein database; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; proteomics; search engine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872332086

These translations provide different yet correlated views of the same set of documents. This gives rise to an intriguing question: can we use the extra information to achieve a better clustering of the documents? Some recent work on multiview clustering provided positive answers to this question. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to address this problem using the constrained clustering framework. Unlike traditional Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints, the constraints generated from machine translation are dense yet noisy. We show how to incorporate this type of constraints by presenting two algorithms, one parametric and one non-parametric. Our algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and can consistently improve the clustering of real data, namely the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 Multilingual Dataset. In contrast to existing multiview clustering algorithms, our technique does not need the compatibility or the conditional independence assumption, nor does it involve subtle parameter tuning. © 2012 ACM.","constrained spectral clustering; document clustering; machine translation","Alternative approach; Automated machines; Conditional independence assumption; Constrained clustering; Data sets; Document Clustering; Intriguing questions; Machine translations; Multi-view clustering; Non-parametric; Parameter-tuning; Reuters; Spectral clustering; Statistical machine translation; Computer aided language translation; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871065736

We present a method to directly learn this phrase table from a parallel corpus of sentences that are not aligned at the word level. The key contribution of this work is that while previous methods have generally only modeled phrases at one level of granularity, in the proposed method phrases of many granularities are included directly in the model. This allows for the direct learning of a phrase table that achieves competitive accuracy without the complicated multistep process of word alignment and phrase extraction that is used in previous research. The model is achieved through the use of non-parametric Bayesian methods and inversion transduction grammars (ITGs), a variety of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs). Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed model matches the accuracy of the more traditional two-step word alignment/phrase extraction approach while reducing its phrase table to a fraction of its original size. © 2012 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Inversion transduction grammars; Non-parametric Bayesian statistics; Phrase alignment; Statistical machine translation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871243911

One of the key technologiesfor improvingmachine translationqualityis the utilizationof syntax. It is difficultto select the appropriate parser for English to Japanese patent machine translation because the effects of each parser on patent translation are not clear. This paper provides an empirical comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art parsers for English, focusing on the effects on patent machine translation from English to Japanese. We add syntax to a method that constrains the reordering of noun phrases for phrase-based statistical machine translation. There are two methods for obtaining the noun phrases from input sentences: 1) an input sentence is directly parsed by a parser and 2) noun phrases from an input sentence are determined by a method using the parsing results of the context document that contains the input sentence. We measured how much each parser contributed to improving the translation quality for each of the two methods and how much a combination of parsers contributed to improving the translation quality for the second method. We conducted experiments using the NTCIR-8 patent translation task dataset. Most of the parsers improved translation quality. Combinations of parsers using the method based on context documents achieved the best translation quality. © 2012 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Comparison; English to Japanese; Parser; Patent translation; Reordering constraint",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871182407

Each frame in an action is considered as a sentence in an article. We believe that, though the appearance for the same action is quite different in different views, there exists some translation relationship between them. To abstract the relationship, we use the IBM Model 1 in statistical machine translation and the translation probabilities for vocabularies in the source view to those in the target view can be obtained from the training data. Consequently, we can translate an action based on the maximum a posteriori criterion. We validated our method on the public multi-view IXMAS dataset and obtained promising results compared to the state-of-the-art knowledge transfer based methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","action recognition; cross view; IBM Model 1; knowledge transfer","Action recognition; cross view; Data sets; Human-action recognition; IBM Models; Knowledge transfer; Maximum a posteriori criteria; Multi-views; Source view; Statistical machine translation; Training data; Abstracting; Biometrics; Gesture recognition; Knowledge management; Linguistics; Motion estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871399946

Laboratory processes of determining PTM sites in proteins are laborious and expensive. On the contrary, computational approaches are far swifter and economical; and the models for prediction of PTMs can be quite accurate too. Among the PTMs, Protein N- terminal N-myristoylation by myristoyl-CoA protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an important lipid anchor modification of eukaryotic and viral proteins; occurring in about 0.5% encoded NMT substrates. Reliable recognition of myristoylation capability from the substrate amino acid sequence is useful for proteomic functional annotation projects as also in building therapeutics targeting the NMT. Using computational techniques, prediction-based models can be developed and new functions of protein substrates can be identified. In this study, we employ Biogeography based Optimization (BBO) for feature selection along with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest for classification of N-myristoylation sequences. The simulations indicate that N-myristoylation sites can be identified with high accuracy using hybrid BBO wrappers in combination with weighted filter methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Amino Acid Indices; Biogeography based Optimization (BBO); dbPTM; N-myristoylation; Post-translational modifications (PTM); Random Forest classifier; Support Vector Machines (SVM); SwissProt","Biogeography-based optimizations; dbPTM; N-myristoylation; Post-translational modifications; Random forest classifier; SWISS-PROT; Acylation; Amino acids; Chemical properties; Decision trees; Ecology; Forecasting; Optimization; Proteins; Substrates; Support vector machines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871571172

But automated translation of file paths is a difficult problem because of the minimal context for translation and the frequent mixing of multiple languages within a path. This work developed a prototype implementation of a file-path translator that first identifies the language for each directory segment of a path, and then translates to English those that are not already English nor artificial words. Brown’s LA-Strings utility for language identification was tried, but its performance was found inadequate on short strings and it was supplemented with clues from dictionary lookup, Unicode character distributions for languages, country of origin, and language-related keywords. To provide better data for language inference, words used in each directory over a large corpus were aggregated for analysis. The resulting directory-language probabilities were combined with those for each path segment from dictionary lookup and character-type distributions to infer the segment’s most likely language. Tests were done on a corpus of 50.1 million file paths looking for 35 different languages. Tests showed 90.4% accuracy on identifying languages of directories and 93.7% accuracy on identifying languages of directory/file segments of file paths, even after excluding 44.4% of the paths as obviously English or untranslatable. Two of seven proposed language clues were shown to impair directory-language identification. Experiments also compared three translation methods: the Systran translation tool, Google Translate, and word-for-word substitution using dictionaries. Google Translate usually performed the best, but all still made errors with European languages and a significant number of errors with Arabic and Chinese. © 2013 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.

This study reports on self-organized behavior in which distributed centimeter-sized modules stochastically aggregate and exhibit a translational wheeling motion. The system consists of two types of centimeter-sized water-floating modules: a triangular-shaped module that is equipped with a vibration motor and a permanent magnet (termed the active module), which can quasi-randomly rove around; and circular modules that are equipped with permanent magnets (termed passive modules). In its quasi-random movement in water, the active module picks up passive modules through magnetic attraction. The contacts between the modules induce a torque transfer from the active module to the passive modules. This results in rotational motion of the passive modules. As a consequence of the shape difference between the triangular module and the circular module, the passive modules rotate like wheels, being kept on the same edges as the active module. The motion of the active module is examined, as well as the characteristics and behavior of the self-organization process. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Magnetism; Self-assembly machines; Self-organized behavior; Stochasticity; Translational wheeling motion","Assembly machines; Magnetism; Magnets; Permanent magnets; Stochastic systems; Biomolecular self assembly; Magnetic attraction; Rotational motion; Self organizations; Self-organization process; Self-organized behaviors; Stochasticity; Translational wheeling motion; Self assembly; water; article; artificial intelligence; chemistry; equipment design; magnetism; methodology; motion; movement (physiology); physics; robotics; rotation; statistical model; statistics; vibration; Artificial Intelligence; Equipment Design; Magnetics; Models, Statistical; Motion; Movement; Physics; Robotics; Rotation; Stochastic Processes; Vibration; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047687003

Our approach marries a machine translation system with the popular picture book. Users interact with picoTrans by pointing at pictures as if it were a picture book; the system generates natural language from these icons and the user is able to interact with the icon sequence to refine the meaning of the words that are generated. When users are satisfied that the sentence generated represents what they wish to express, they tap a translate button and picoTrans displays the translation. Structuring the process of communication in this way has many advantages. First, tapping icons is a very natural method of user input on mobile devices; typing is cumbersome and speech input errorful. Second, the sequence of icons which is annotated both with pictures and bilingually with words is meaningful to both users, and it opens up a second channel of communication between them that conveys the gist of what is being expressed. We performed a number of evaluations of picoTrans to determine: its coverage of a corpus of in-domain sentences; the input efficiency in terms of the number of key presses required relative to text entry; and users' overall impressions of using the system compared to using a picture book. Our results show that we are able to cover 74% of the expressions in our test corpus using a 2000-icon set; we believe that this icon set size is realistic for a mobile device. We also found that picoTrans requires fewer key presses than typing the input and that the system is able to predict the correct, intended natural language sentence from the icon sequence most of the time, making user interaction with the icon sequence often unnecessary. In the user evaluation, we found that in general users prefer using picoTrans and are able to communicate more rapidly and expressively.

To ensure their reliable estimation and to prevent overfitting, we use a two-phase learning algorithm. First, the contribution of individual sparse features is estimated using large amounts of parallel data. Second, a small development corpus is used to determine the relative contributions of the sparse features and standard dense features. Not only does this two-phase learning approach prevent overfitting, the second pass optimizes corpus-level BLEU of the Viterbi translation of the decoder. We demonstrate significant improvements using sparse rule indicator features in three different translation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale discriminative training algorithm capable of showing improvements over the MERT baseline with only rule indicator features in addition to the standard MERT features. © 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Linguistics; Translation (languages); Discriminative learning; Discriminative training; Learning approach; Learning parameters; Machine translations; Relative contribution; Sparse features; Statistical machine translation; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961320916

Understanding correctly these texts is not simple because of the lexical ambiguity caused by the diversity in adding diacritics to a given accentless sequence. There have been some methods for solving the vietnamese accentless texts problem known as accent prediction and they have obtained promising results. Those methods are usually based on distance matching, n-gram, dictionary of words and phrases and heuristic techniques. In this paper, we propose a new method solving the accent prediction. Our method combine the strength of previous methods (combining n-gram method and phrase dictionary in general). This method considers the accent predicting as statistical machine translation (SMT) problem with source language as accentless texts and target language as accent texts, respectively. We also improve quality of accent predicting by applying some techniques such as adding dictionary, changing order of language model and tuning.

In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process.

When mapping ontologies that use the same language, the existent approaches have been shown to produce significant results, being able to handle complex descriptions of the enclosed concepts and properties. In order to expand the applied linguistic methods in a cross-language context, i.e. to align ontologies that use different languages, it is essential to automate the process of finding lexical correspondences, beyond simple term translation, between the entity descriptions provided by the involved ontologies. The present paper proposes a machine learning approach to obtain the optimal from a set of translation provided by different automated machine translation services, in order to use it as the basis for aligning ontology pairs that provide complex descriptions expressed in different languages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.","Automated Machine Translation; Cross-language Alignment; Machine Learning; Ontology Alignment","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided language translation; Learning systems; Metadata; Research; Semantics; Automated machines; Cross languages; Linguistic analysis; Linguistic methods; Machine learning approaches; Machine translation models; Ontology alignment; Term translations; Linguistics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904695535

In theory, Feferman and Vaught in 1959 proposed a method to reduce solution of First Order definable problems on Disjoint Union of structures to solutions of derived problems on the components with some post-processing of the obtained results. In practice, the literature is very reach in examples of particular methods to deal with different variations of graphs, built from components. From the theoretical point of view we adapt and generalize the Feferman-Vaught method. We define a new kind of decomposable graphs: sum-like graphs and propose a new systematic approach, which allows us to reduce the solution of Monadic Second Order definable problems on such graphs to the solution of effectively derivable Monadic Second Order definable problems on the components. From the practical point of view, we consider in great details one application of our approach in the field of parallel computations on distributed data. © 2013 IEEE.","Behaviour of Finite State Machine; Decomposable graphs; Finite State Machine; Monadic Second Order Logic; Sum-like Graphs; Translation Scheme","Computation theory; Finite automata; Decomposable graphs; Distributed data; Monadic second-order logic; Parallel Computation; Sum-like Graphs; Theoretical approach; Theoretical points; Translation schemes; Graphic methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904567061

Since estimating the probabilities of rules extracted from hypergraphs is an NP-complete problem, they propose a divide-andconquer strategy by decomposing a hypergraph into a set of independent subhypergraphs. However, they employ a Bull's algorithm to enumerate all consistent alignments for each rule in each subhypergraph, which is very time-consuming especially for the rules that contain non-terminals. This limits the applicability of this method to the syntax translation models, the rules of which contain many non-terminals (e.g. SCFG rules). In response to this problem, we propose an inside-outside algorithm to efficiently enumerate the consistent alignments. Experimental results show that our method is twice as fast as the Bull's algorithm. In addition, the efficient dynamic programming algorithm makes our approach applicable to syntax-based translation models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Optimization; Statistical machine translation; Weighted alignment hypergraph","Computational complexity; Dynamic programming; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Optimization; Syntactics; Compact representation; Dynamic programming algorithm; Hypergraph; Statistical machine translation; Translation models; Word alignment; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901502976

Thread level parallel processing is required to efficiently utilize the performance of multicore processors. To realize the automatic parallel processing that does not require program source codes, we develop a system that can parallelize sequential program binary code to the parallelized one by using dynamic binary translation facility of Valgrind. Since the Valgrind searches for the translated code of each basic block whenever each basic block of target program binary code is executed, the translation process itself becomes the runtime overhead and might cause the obstacle of performance improvement. Toward this problem, we develop two methods for reducing the number of search processes of translated codes. One method is that a basic block directly jumps to itself without passing through the search process within the Valgrind system core when the next basic block is the same as the current block itself. The other method is that multiple basic blocks are translated at a time to allow each block to directly jump to next one. Preliminary evaluation shows that our two methods can reduce 36% of the execution cycles, with the optimization facility of Valgrind enabled. © 2013 IEEE.","automatic parallelization; dynamic binary translation; runtime overhead; thread level parallel processing","Binary codes; Parallel processing systems; Program translators; Automatic Parallelization; Dynamic binary translation; Multi-core processor; Parallel processing; Program source codes; Runtime overheads; Sequential programs; Translation process; Multicore programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894116516

We experiment with movie review and product review datasets consisting of polar texts in English and Turkish. The results of the study show that expanding training size with new instances taken from another corpus does not necessarily increase classification accuracy. And this happens primarily not due to (not always accurate) machine translation, but because of the inherent differences in corpora between two subsets written in different languages. Similarly, in case of co-training classification with machine translation we observe from the results that accuracy improvement can be explained by semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data coming from the same domain, but not due to cross-language co-training itself. Our results also show that amount of artificial noise added by machine translation services does not hinder classifiers much in polarity detection task. However, it is important to distinguish the effect of machine translation from the effect of merging different cross-lingual data sources and that like in case of transfer learning we may need to search for ways to account for cross-lingual data distribution differences.","Machine translation; Multi-lingual polarity detection","Data mining; Linguistics; Supervised learning; Accuracy Improvement; Classification accuracy; Cross-lingual settings; Data distribution; Machine translations; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890580303

The common assumption is that parallel texts are symmetrical: The direction of translation is deemed irrelevant and is consequently ignored. Much research in Translation Studies indicates that the direction of translation matters, however, as translated language (translationese) has many unique properties. It has already been shown that phrase tables constructed from parallel corpora translated in the same direction as the translation task outperform those constructed from corpora translated in the opposite direction. We reconfirm that this is indeed the case, but emphasize the importance of also using texts translated in the ""wrong"" direction.We take advantage of information pertaining to the direction of translation in constructing phrase tables by adapting the translation model to the special properties of translationese. We explore two adaptation techniques: First, we create a mixture model by interpolating phrase tables trained on texts translated in the ""right"" and the ""wrong"" directions. The weights for the interpolation are determined by minimizing perplexity. Second, we define entropy-based measures that estimate the correspondence of target-language phrases to translationese, thereby eliminating the need to annotate the parallel corpus with information pertaining to the direction of translation.We show that incorporating these measures as features in the phrase tables of statistical machine translation systems results in consistent, statistically significant improvement in the quality of the translation. © 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Interpolation; Adaptation techniques; Parallel corpora; Parallel text; Special properties; Statistical machine translation; Statistical machine translation system; Target language; Translation models; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888123027

But automated translation of file paths is a difficult problem because of the minimal context for translation and the frequent mixing of multiple languages within a path. This work developed a prototype implementation of a file-path translator that first identifies the language for each directory segment of a path, and then translates to English those that are not already English nor artificial words. Brown's LA-Strings utility for language identification was tried, but its performance was found inadequate on short strings and it was supplemented with clues from dictionary lookup, Unicode character distributions for languages, country of origin, and language-related keywords. To provide better data for language inference, words used in each directory over a large corpus were aggregated for analysis. The resulting directory-language probabilities were combined with those for each path segment from dictionary lookup and character-type distributions to infer the segment's most likely language. Tests were done on a corpus of 50.1 million file paths looking for 35 different languages. Tests showed 90.4% accuracy on identifying languages of directories and 93.7% accuracy on identifying languages of directory/file segments of file paths, even after excluding 44.4% of the paths as obviously English or untranslatable. Two of seven proposed language clues were shown to impair directory-language identification. Experiments also compared three translation methods: the Systran translation tool, Google Translate, and word-for-word substitution using dictionaries. Google Translate usually performed the best, but all still made errors with European languages and a significant number of errors with Arabic and Chinese. © 2013 Josiah Dykstra and Alan T. Sherman.

The paper holds that if the cultural context analysis is paid enough attention in MT, the literal meaning and cultural connotation of source language can be exactly and completely translated into target language so as to improve the quality of MT.

As many enterprises have branches in several countries and provide similar services throughout the globe, there is high potential for re-using these process models. However, the language barrier is a major obstacle for the successful re-use of process models, especially in multi-national companies. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting the Business Process Model Translator (BPMT), a technique for the automated translation of business process models that eases the re-use of business process models and reduces redundant work in multi-national companies. It builds upon the state-of-the-art machine translation system Moses and extends it with word and translation disambiguation considering the context of the domain. As a result, the BPMT can successfully deal with the compact and special language fragments that are typically found in business process models.

The fixations that are associated with clusters that map with high probability to corresponding locations on the other print are likely to have greater utility in a visual matching task.

Within this context, it becomes essential to meet the UOC's linguistic needs taking into account its particular characteristics.

In order to continue adapting and adding value to the existing tool for generalisable large-scale applications, the UOC's translation system has recently implemented a semantic filter based on subject fields aimed at improving the translation quality and at better fitting the university needs. The paper will explain all the steps of this adaptive process, as well as a demonstration of the resulting tool: (a) the choice of the subject fields according to the university studies, (b) the design and implementation of the dictionaries used to extract the required information to filter and disambiguate homonym and polysemous terms, including source code in the dictionaries, and (c) the design and implementation of the corresponding web interface. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870552910

Through this and to make it possible, we introduce a new formalism for syntactic analysis called Unification Link Grammar as a result of adding unification paradigms to link grammar. This brings about some other benefits such as more generative power, less complexity and being well organized for knowledge extraction. Based on this new formalism, we develop a translation method which is completely compatible with the linguistic basis of link grammar. This approach transfers graphs by using some kind of correspondence between the nodes and without using so called sub-constituents, sub-graphs or any similar concept. The introduced algorithm has a linear order time complexity.

Therefore, existence of automatic writing assistance tools such as spell and grammar checker/correctors can increase the quality of electronic texts by removing noise and correcting the erroneous sentences. Different kinds of errors in a text can be categorized into spelling, grammatical and real-word errors. In this article, we present a language-independent approach based on a statistical machine translation framework to develop a proofreading tool, which detects grammatical errors as well as context-sensitive spelling mistakes (real-word errors). A hybrid model for grammar checking is suggested by combining the mentioned approach with an existing rule-based grammar checker. Experimental results on both English and Persian languages indicate that the proposed statistical method and the rule-based grammar checker are complementary in detecting and correcting syntactic errors. The results of the hybrid grammar checker, applied to some English texts, show an improvement of about 24% with respect to the recall metric with almost similar value for precision.

However, most of them also lose merits due to the strict policy of matching of n-grams. Especially, the policy of exact matching leads to take synonyms as totally different words and thus give unreasonable estimation. This paper introduces fuzzy matching for n-grams, which refers to a semantic similarity function based on WordNet. And it is used to find a match with the highest similarity when incorporated into BLEU, the representative of n-gram-based evaluation metrics. Since WordNet can contribute more to high-order n-grams and fuzzy matching can perform well even with fewer references, experiments on MTC Part 2 (LDC2003T17) show our proposed method can greatly improve correlation between BLEU and human evaluation both at segment-level and document-level.

After analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, we show how to improve the detection of multi-word translation units and evaluate these improvements on machine translation tasks. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Association measures; Phrase-based machine translation; Sub-sentential alignment","Alternative approach; Association measures; Isolated words; Phrase-based machine translations; Probabilistic models; Sampling-based; Statistical machine translation system; Translation unit; Computer aided language translation; Alignment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875743779

However, to reap these benefits, groups need to overcome communication barriers that stem from differences in members' native languages. We compare two strategies for overcoming these barriers: the use of English as a common language, and the use of machine translation (MT) tools that allow each person to communicate in his or her own native language. Dyads consisting of one English-speaking American and one native Mandarin-speaking Chinese participant exchanged ideas to perform brainstorming tasks, either through English or using MT. We found that MT helped the non-native English speakers produce ideas but that both native and non-native English speakers viewed MT-mediated messages as less comprehensible than English messages. The findings suggest it can be effective to support crosslingual communication with asymmetric design, using MT technology to help people produce messages in their native languages, while leaving incoming messages untranslated and leveraging people's second language proficiency for comprehension.

Because of unavoidable translation errors, multilingual communication cannot accurately transfer information. We propose to shift from the transparentchannel metaphor to the human-interpreter (agent) metaphor. Instead of viewing machine translation mediated communication as a transparent channel, the interpreter (agent) encourages the dialog participants to collaborate, as their interactivity will be helpful in reducing the number of translation errors, the noise of the channel. We examine the translation issues raised by multilingual communication, and analyze the impact of interactivity on the elimination of translation errors. We propose an implementation of the agent metaphor, which promotes interactivity between dialog participants and the machine translator. We design the architecture of our agent, analyze the interaction process, describe decision support and autonomous behavior, and provide an example of repair strategy preparation. We conduct an English-Chinese communication task experiment on tangram arrangement.

After comparing two types of segmentation strategies with associated linguistic resources, we demonstrate that optimizing segmentation itself does not guarantee better MT performance, and segmentation strategy choice is not the key to improve MT. Instead, we discover that linguistical resources such as segmented corpora or the dictionaries that segmentation tools rely on actually determine how word segmentation affects machine translation.

The idea is to use the annotated resources of one language (say, L1) for performing Sentiment Analysis in another language (say, L2) which does not have annotated resources. The success of such a scheme crucially depends on the availability of a MT system between L1 and L2. We argue that such a strategy ignores the fact that a Machine Translation system is much more demanding in terms of resources than a Sentiment Analysis engine. Moreover, these approaches fail to take into account the divergence in the expression of sentiments across languages. We provide strong experimental evidence to prove that even the best of such systems do not outperform a system trained using only a few polarity annotated documents in the target language. Having a very large number of documents in L1 also does not help because most Machine Learning approaches converge (or reach a plateau) after a certain training size (as demonstrated by our results). Based on our study, we take the stand that languages which have a genuine need for a Sentiment Analysis engine should focus on collecting a few polarity annotated documents in their language instead of relying on CLSA. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Cross languages; Experimental evidence; Machine learning approaches; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Sentiment analysis; Target language; Training size; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Engines; Text processing; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875512942

To measure the accuracy of connective translation (ACT), the metric relies on automatic word-level alignment between a source sentence and respectively the reference and candidate translations, along with other heuristics for comparing translations of discourse connectives. Using a dictionary of equivalents, the translations are scored automatically, or, for better precision, semi-automatically. The precision of the ACT metric is assessed by human judges on sample data for English/French and English/Arabic translations: the ACT scores are on average within 2% of human scores.

Code region formation is the most important first step in all DBTs and DBOs. The quality of the dynamically formed code regions determines the extent and the types of optimization opportunities that can be exposed to DBTs and DBOs, and thus, determines the ultimate quality of the final optimized code. The Next-Executing-Tail (NET) trace formation method used in HP Dynamo is an early example of such techniques. Many existing trace formation schemes are variants of NET. They work very well for most binary traces, but they also suffer a major problem: the formed traces may contain a large number of early exits that could be branched out during the execution. If this happens frequently, the program execution will spend more time in the slow binary interpreter or in the unoptimized code regions than in the optimized traces in code cache. The benefit of the trace optimization is thus lost. Traces/regions with frequently taken early-exits are called delinquent traces/regions. Our empirical study shows that at least 8 of the 12 SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks have delinquent traces. In this paper, we propose a light-weight region formation technique called Early-Exit Guided Region Formation (EEG) to improve the quality of the formed traces/regions. It iteratively identifies and merges delinquent regions into larger code regions. We have implemented our EEG algorithm in two LLVM-based multithreaded DBTs targeting ARM and IA32 instruction set architecture (ISA), respectively.

Our techniques are inspired by hand-tuned seismic ker- nels on GPUs. The solutions we develop reduce the cost of transferring data across multiple memories with differ- ent bandwidth, latency and addressability properties. They result in reduction of communication volumes from main memory and faster execution speeds, comparable to hand- tuned implementations, for out-of-place stencils. We discuss various steps of our source-to-source compiler infrastructure and focus on specific optimizations which comprise: flexible generation of different granularities of communications with respect to computations, reduction of redundant transfers, reuse of data across processing elements using a globally ad- dressable local memory and reuse of data within the same processing elements using a local private memory. The mod- els of memory we consider in our techniques support the GPU model with device, shared and register memories. The techniques we derive are generally applicable and their for- mulation within our compiler can be extended to other types of architectures.

Even in countries where English is an official language, such as the United States, language can be a barrier for accessing biomedical information for non-native speakers. Recent progress in machine translation suggests that this technique could help make English texts accessible to speakers of other languages. However, the lack of adequate specialized corpora needed to train statistical models currently limits the quality of automatic translations in the biomedical domain.Results: We show how a large-sized parallel corpus can automatically be obtained for the biomedical domain, using the MEDLINE database. The corpus generated in this work comprises article titles obtained from MEDLINE and abstract text automatically retrieved from journal websites, which substantially extends the corpora used in previous work. After assessing the quality of the corpus for two language pairs (English/French and English/Spanish) we use the Moses package to train a statistical machine translation model that outperforms previous models for automatic translation of biomedical text.Conclusions: We have built translation data sets in the biomedical domain that can easily be extended to other languages available in MEDLINE. These sets can successfully be applied to train statistical machine translation models. While further progress should be made by incorporating out-of-domain corpora and domain-specific lexicons, we believe that this work improves the automatic translation of biomedical texts. © 2013 Jimeno Yepes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biomedical domain; Multilingual corpus generation; Statistical machine translation","Automatic translation; Biomedical domain; Biomedical information; Machine translations; Multilingual corpus generation; Non-native speakers; Specialized corpora; Statistical machine translation; Abstracting; Database systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Translation (languages); article; linguistics; Medline; methodology; publishing; statistical model; translating (language); Linguistics; MEDLINE; Models, Statistical; Publishing; Translating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876783275

Thus these researchers think it is appropriate to translate organization names with some web mining based methods. However, the correctness of these assumptions has never been verified. In this paper, we focus on this issue and experimentally verify the correctness of these two assumptions. And from our experimental results, we find out several useful distribution characteristics of the organization names that appears on the web. Based on these distribution characteristics, a practical Chinese-English organization name translation method is proposed. Experimental results show that our method is effective.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which native English speakers interacted with a Mandarin-speaking confederate using machine translation. Participants performed three brainstorming tasks, under each of three conditions: no highlighting, keyword highlighting, and random highlighting. Our results indicated that people consider the identical messages clearer and less distracting when keywords in the message are highlighted.

This parameter tuning usually involves generating translations at different points in the parameter space and obtaining feedback against human-authored reference translations as to how good the translations. This feedback then dictates what point in the parameter space should be explored next. To measure this feedback, it is generally considered wise to have multiple (usually 4) reference translations to avoid unfair penalization of translation hypotheses which could easily happen given the large number of ways in which a sentence can be translated from one language to another. However, this reliance on multiple reference translations creates a problem since they are labor intensive and expensive to obtain. Therefore, most current MT datasets only contain a single reference. This leads to the problem of reference sparsity. In our previously published research, we had proposed the first paraphrase-based solution to this problem and evaluated its effect on Chinese-English translation. In this article, we first present extended results for that solution on additional source languages. More importantly, we present a novel way to generate ""targeted"" paraphrases that yields substantially larger gains (up to 2.7 BLEU points) in translation quality when compared to our previous solution (up to 1.6 BLEU points).

The key insight behind the process is that it is possible to spot likely translation errors with only monolingual knowledge of the target language, and it is possible to generate alternative ways to say the same thing (i.e., paraphrases) with only monolingual knowledge of the source language. Formal evaluation demonstrates that this approach can yield substantial improvements in translation quality, and the idea has been integrated into a broader framework for monolingual collaborative translation that produces fully accurate, fully fluent translations for a majority of sentences in a real-world translation task, with no involvement of human bilingual speakers. ©2013 ACM.","Crowdsourcing; Human computation; Machine translation; Monolingual; Paraphrase; Translation; Translation interface; Wisdom of crowds","Crowdsourcing; Human computation; Machine translations; Monolingual; Paraphrase; Wisdom of crowds; Translation (languages); Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880226746

As a result, additional lexical processing steps such as morphological analysis, transliteration, and tokenization are required to process the internal structure of words to help cope with data-sparsity issues that occur when simply dividing words according to white spaces. In this paper, we take a different approach: not dividing lexical processing and translation into two steps, but simply viewing translation as a single transduction between character strings in the source and target languages. In particular, we demonstrate that the key to achieving accuracies on a par with word-based translation in the character-based framework is the use of a many-to-many alignment strategy that can accurately capture correspondences between arbitrary substrings. We build on the alignment method proposed in Neubig et al. (Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

In this study, we make a step in that direction and present an attempt to evaluate the quality of the phrase-based translation model. In order to identify those translation errors that stem from deficiencies in the phrase table, we propose to compute the oracle BLEU-4 score, that is the best score that a system based on this phrase table can achieve on a reference corpus. By casting the computation of the oracle BLEU-1 as an Integer Linear Programming problem, we show that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate upper-bounds of this score, and report measures performed on several standard benchmarks.

This paper presents English to Arabic approach for translating well-structured English sentences into well-structured Arabic sentences, using a grammar-based and example-translation techniques to handle the problems of ordering and agreement. This technique combines rule-based MT (RBMT) and example-based MT (EBMT) which is called hybrid-based MT (HERBMT). The proposed methodology is flexible and scalable. The main advantages of HERBMT are that it combines the advantages of RBMT and EBMT, and it can be applied to other languages with minor modifications. EBMT extracts an example of target language sentences that are analogous to input source language sentences. The extraction of appropriate translated sentences is preceded by an analysis stage for the decomposition of input sentences into appropriate fragments. RBMT is used when examples of the source language to be translated into the target language are not found in the machine database. The OAK Parser is used to analyze the input English text to get the part of speech (POS) for each word in the text as a pre-translation process. A major design goal of this system is that it will be used as a stand-alone tool, and can be integrated with a general machine translation system for English sentences. The evaluation is carried out on 250 independent test suites, and the analysis indicates that HERBMT achieved good performance with an average of 97.2% precision. © 2013 IEEE.","Agreement; Example-based; Hybrid-based; MT; OAK Parser; Rule-Based; Word reorder","Example-based; Hybrid-based; MT; OAK Parser; Rule based; Word reorder; Communication; Contracts; Information technology; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879038804

In particular, we explore the potential of using predicates that make explicit the hidden relation that holds between the nouns that form the noun compound. For example, mosquito that carries malaria is a paraphrase of the compound malaria mosquito in which the verb explicitly states the semantic relation between the two nouns. We study the utility of using such paraphrasing verbs, with associated weights, to build a representation of the semantics of a noun compound, for example, malaria mosquito can be represented as follows: carry (23), spread (16), cause (12), transmit (9), and so on. We also explore the potential of using multiple paraphrasing verbs as features for predicting abstract semantic relations such as CAUSE, and we demonstrate that using explicit paraphrases can help improve statistical machine translation. © 2013 ACM.","Lexical semantics; Machine translation; Multiword expressions; Noun compounds; Paraphrases; Web as a corpus","Lexical semantics; Machine translations; Multi-word expressions; Noun compounds; Paraphrases; Web as a corpus; Diseases; Semantics; Stem cells; Semantic Web",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880214824

They are used in many different systems, such as emulation, instrumentation tools and innovative HW/SW co-designed microarchitectures. Although many researchers worked on characterizing and reducing the emulation over-head, there are no published results that explain how the DBTO behaves from the microarchitectural prospective and how its behavior may be predicted based on high-level, guest application statistics. Such results are important for guiding design decisions and system optimization. In this paper we study the DBTO as an independent application by dividing its functionality into modules. We show that the behavior of the DBTO is not constant at all. The contribution of the different modules in the total overhead, the overhead itself, the microarchitectural interaction with the emulated application and the microarchitectural proffle of the different modules changes significantly based on the emulated application. This result comes in contrast to numerous papers that consider this behavior constant and exclude the DBTO from the simulation. Throughout this paper we detail this variance, we quantify it and we explain the reasons behind it. The insights presented in this work can be exploited towards the design of more efficient DBTOs and their early performance evaluation.

Constraint application is one key feature that makes a generated translation candidate in Generate and Repair Machine Translation (GRMT) very close to a perfect translation. Constraints represent syntactic differences between the source language (SL) and the target language (TL). These constraints are used to ameliorate syntactic differences between the SL and that of the TL, to refine the scope of translation choices of each input word, and to complete the syntax of the translation language. One set of constraints can be applied to languages, e.g., Chinese, Japanese and Thai which share common significant (syntactic) features. Our constraints are used with GRMT to translate back and forth between English and Thai. Examples are provided throughout the paper to illustrate the uses of the constraints. Some constraint applications on Chinese and Japanese are also provided. Other considerations on ordering are presented as well. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.

Code region formation is the most important first step in all DBTs and DBOs. The quality of the dynamically formed code regions determines the extent and the types of optimization opportunities that can be exposed to DBTs and DBOs, and thus, determines the ultimate quality of the final optimized code. The Next-Executing-Tail (NET) trace formation method used in HP Dynamo is an early example of such techniques. Many existing trace formation schemes are variants of NET. They work very well for most binary traces, but they also suffer a major problem: the formed traces may contain a large number of early exits that could be branched out during the execution. If this happens frequently, the program execution will spend more time in the slow binary interpreter or in the unoptimized code regions than in the optimized traces in code cache. The benefit of the trace optimization is thus lost. Traces/regions with frequently taken early-exits are called delinquent traces/regions. Our empirical study shows that at least 8 of the 12 SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks have delinquent traces. In this paper, we propose a light-weight region formation technique called Early-Exit Guided Region Formation (EEG) to improve the quality of the formed traces/regions.

In addition to the commonly used edit distance between the raw translation and its edited version, we consider post-editing time and keystroke logging, since these can account not only for technical effort, but also cognitive effort. In this system ranking scenario, post-editing poses some important challenges: i) multiple post-editors are required since having the same annotator fixing alternative translations of a given input segment can bias their post-editing; ii) achieving high enough inter-annotator agreement requires extensive training, which is not always feasible; iii) there exists a natural variation among post-editors, particularly w.r.t. editing time and keystrokes, which makes their measurements less directly comparable.

Furthermore, the phrase probability induction is carried out on the basis of the topic similarity, allowing the translation system to consider the semantic relatedness among different rules.

This forms an obstacle for other researchers to take full advantages of them, especially when they undertake the multilingual research. To address this problem and to facilitate future research in unsupervised induction of syntactic structures, some researchers have developed a universal POS tag set. However, the disaccord problem of the phrase tag sets remains unsolved. Trying to bridge the phrase level tag sets of multilingual treebanks, this paper designs a phrase mapping between the French Treebank and the English Penn Treebank. Furthermore, one of the potential applications of this mapping work is explored in the machine translation evaluation task.

One is that the building of knowledge base (KB) is painstakingly handcrafted from scratch, and the other is that the most KBs for machine translation (MT) lack supports from powerful theory system based on semantic understanding. This paper focuses on the building of semantic knowledge base (SKB) guided by the Concept of Hierarchical Network (HNC) theory which is suitable for machine translation. Besides bilingual general attributes, the semantic attributes at all levels are described in a word such as concept category, semantic representation, and sentence category and concept relation. By doing this, we try to solve the semantic mapping problems between Chinese and English at the level of word, chunk and sentence.

The system performance is directly affected by the correctness of long sentence processing. A basic thought for processing a long sentence is to partition it into short sub-sentences and to merge the sub-translations for the whole translation. In this paper, a rule-based top-down partitioning algorithm is provided. The rules are inducted from sentence patterns and use regular expressions as main part. Firstly, the algorithm reduces some sentence components to shorten the sentence; then coordinate sub-sentences are recognized and partitioned; finally, clauses within sub-sentences are processed.

Constraint application is one key feature that makes a generated translation candidate in Generate and Repair Machine Translation (GRMT) very close to a perfect translation. Constraints represent syntactic differences between the source language (SL) and the target language (TL). These constraints are used to ameliorate syntactic differences between the SL and that of the TL, to refine the scope of translation choices of each input word, and to complete the syntax of the translation language. One set of constraints can be applied to languages, e.g., Chinese, Japanese and Thai which share common significant (syntactic) features. Our constraints are used with GRMT to translate back and forth between English and Thai. Examples are provided throughout the paper to illustrate the uses of the constraints.

Finally, by comparing the conditional probability distributions of the words held in common by Ref and the candidate sentence (Cand) using Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can score the hypothesis. ELEXR can evaluate MT by using only one Ref assigned to each Cand without incorporating any semantic annotated resources like WordNet.

Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. The proposed topic-based coherence model then uses the predicted target coherence chain to help decoder select coherent word/phrase translations.

Its terminology also differs from other branches of medical science. As homoeopathy rests on a basic principle of nature, allopathic or other western methods do not pay any attention to the symptoms of the patient and the medicine is prescribed on the basis of the name of the ailment, whatever are the symptoms? An English-Hindi machine translation (MT) system for the translation of allopathic terminologies requires to translate only the ailment, therapeutic description, name of remedies and doctor's recommendation, but when it comes to translating the homoeopathic contents, necessitate to translate the general symptoms of the patient, ailments, name of medicines, and prescription. In fact the general medical MT system may not use symbols, doctor's prescriptions, symptoms of patient and medicines with potencies (such as Ipecac Q or 30, Ferrum met. 3X, Syphilinum 1M) the way they are used in Homoeopathy. In this paper, we try to explore the structure of homoeopathic language and compare it with the allopathic language which we experienced during the design of English-Hindi MT system for Homoeopathy.

By exploring this search space, it is possible to analyze and understand the failures of PBSMT systems. Indeed, useful diagnoses can be obtained by computing the so-called oracle hypotheses, which are hypotheses in the search space that have the highest quality score. For standard SMT metrics, this problem is, however, NP-hard and can only be solved approximately. In this work, we present two new methods for efficiently computing oracles on lattices: the first one is based on a linear approximation of the corpus BLEU score and is solved using generic shortest distance algorithms; the second one relies on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of the oracle decoding that incorporates count clipping constraints. It can either be solved directly using a standard ILP solver or using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. These new decoders are evaluated and compared with several alternatives from the literature for three language pairs, using lattices produced by two PBSMT systems. © 2013 ACM 1550-4875/2013/12-ART17 15.00.","BLEU; Integer linear programming; Lattices; Machine translation; Oracle decoding","BLEU; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Distance algorithm; Integer Linear Programming; Lagrangian relaxation techniques; Linear approximations; Machine translations; Phrase-based statistical machine translation; Computer aided language translation; Crystal lattices; Decoding; Integer programming; Approximation algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891861055

This phenomenon may lead to the ambiguity for reader when reading a non-diacritic text. The automatic diacritic restoration problem has been proposed and resolved in several languages using the character-based approach, word-based approach, point-wise approach, etc. However, these approaches lean heavily on the linguistics information, size of training corpus and sometime they are language dependent. In this paper, a simple and effective restoration method will be presented. The machine translation approach will be used as a new solution for this problem. The restoration method has been applied for Vietnamese language, and integrated in an Android application named VIVA (Vietnamese Voice Assistant) that reads out the content of incoming text messages on mobile phone.

The original goal of the Cetus project was to create an easy-to-use compiler for research in automatic parallelization of C programs. In meantime, Cetus has been used for many additional program transformation tasks. It serves as a compiler infrastructure for many projects in the US and internationally. Recently, Cetus has been supported by the National Science Foundation to build a community resource. The compiler has gone through several iterations of benchmark studies and implementations of those techniques that could improve the parallel performance of these programs. These efforts have resulted in a system that favorably compares with state-of-the-art parallelizers, such as Intel's ICC. A key limitation of advanced optimizing compilers is their lack of runtime information, such as the program input data. We will discuss and evaluate several techniques that support dynamic optimization decisions. Finally, as there is an extensive body of proposed compiler analyses and transformations for parallelization, the question of the importance of the techniques arises. This paper evaluates the impact of the individual Cetus techniques on overall program performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automatic parallelization; Compiler infrastructure; Performance; Source-to-source translation","Automatic Parallelization; Compiler infrastructure; National Science Foundations; Optimizing compilers; Performance; Program transformations; Run-time information; Source-to-source translations; Benchmarking; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881372185

The classification of the data is then used to distinguish between the different dialects, split the data accordingly, and utilize the new splits for several adaptation techniques.

In contrast to other continuous space approach, RBM based models can easily be integrated into the decoder and are able to directly learn a hidden representation of the n-gram. Previous work on RBM-based language models do not use a shared word representation and therefore, they might suffer of a lack of generalization for larger contexts. Moreover, since the training step is very time consuming, they are only used for quite small copora. In this work we add a shared word representation for the RBMbased language model by factorizing the weight matrix. In addition, we propose an efficient and tailored sampling algorithm that allows us to drastically speed up the training process. Experiments are carried out on two German to English translation tasks and the results show that the training time could be reduced by a factor of 10 without any drop in performance. Furthermore, the RBM-based model can also be trained on large size corpora. © The Authors.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Combining techniques; Continuous spaces; Machine translations; Restricted boltzmann machine; Sampling algorithm; Training process; Weight matrices; Word representations; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992371966

The comparison is carried out through a regression analysis between feature values and MT performance gains by dynamically adapted versus non-adapted MT engines, on five different translation tasks.

This study concentrates on the translation of Arabic text to its equivalent in Malay language. The problem of this research is the syntactic and morphological differences between Arabic and Malay adjective sentences. The main aim of this study is to design and develop Arabic-Malay machine translation model. First, we analyze the adjective role in the Arabic and Malay languages. Based on this analysis, we identify the transfer bilingual rules form source language to target language so that the translation of source language to target language can be performed by computers successfully. Then, we build and implement a machine translation prototype called AMTS to translate from Arabic to Malay based on rule based approach. The system is evaluated on set of simple Arabic sentences. The techniques used to evaluate the correctness of the system translation are the BLEU metric algorithm and the human judgment. The results of the BLEU algorithm show that the AMTS system performs better than Google in the translation of Arabic sentences into Malay. In addition, the average accuracy given by human judges is 92.3% for our system and 75.3% for Google. © 2014 Science Publications.","Arabic; Machine translation; Malay; Rule-Based",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987704723

We experimented with several methods for data cleaning and automatic spelling correction of query terms. For data cleaning, the most effective method was to employ simple HTML markup removal. The more advanced cleaning methods which remove boilerplate decreased retrieval performance. Automatic correction of spelling errors performed on the English queries for the monolingual task proved to be efficient and leaded to our best P@10 score equal to 0.5360. In the multilingual retrieval task, we employed the Khresmoi medical translation system developed at the Charles University in Prague and translated the source queries from Czech, German, and French to English and employed the same retrieval system as for the monolingual task.

We describe a new translator interface, extensive modifications to a phrasebased MT system, and a novel objective function for re-tuning to human corrections. Evaluation with professional bilingual translators shows that post-edit is faster than interactive at the cost of translation quality for French-English and English- German. However, re-tuning the MT system to interactive output leads to larger, statistically significant reductions in HTER versus re-tuning to post-edit.

Native German speakers find it difficult to understand how Chinese sentences convey meanings without using cases. Statistical machine translation tools may deliver correct German-Chinese translations, but would not explain educational matters. This article reviews some interdisciplinary research on bilingualism, and expounds on how translation is carried out through cross-linguistic cue switching processes. Machine translation approaches are revisited from the perspective of cue switching concluding that: the word order cue is explicitly simulated in all machine translation approaches, and the case cue being implicitly simulated in statistical machine translation approaches can be explicitly simulated in rule-based and example-based machine translation approaches. A convergent result of machine translation research is to advocate an explicit deep-linguistic representation. Here, a novel machine translation method is motivated by blending existing machine translation methods from the viewpoint of cue-switching, and is firstly aimed as an educational tool. This approach takes a limited amount of German-Chinese translations in textbooks as examples, whose cues can be manually obtained, and for which we have developed MultiNet-like deep linguistic representations and cross-linguistic cue-switching processes. Based on this corpus, our present tool is aimed at helping native German speakers to learn Chinese more efficiently, and shall later be expanded to a more comprehensive machine translation system. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Blending; Computational linguistics; Switching; Text processing; Tools; Example-based machine translation; Interdisciplinary research; Linguistic representations; Machine translation methods; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Statistical machine translation; Switching process; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958551362

In particular, professional translators consider the ability of MT systems to adapt to the feedback provided by them to be crucial. In this paper, we propose an adaptation scheme to tune a statistical MT system to a translation project using small amounts of post-edited texts, like those generated by a single user in even just one day of work. The same scheme can be applied on a larger scale in order to focus general purpose models towards the specific domain of interest. We assess our method on two domains, namely information technology and legal, and four translation directions, from English to French, Italian, Spanish and German. The main outcome is that our adaptation strategy can be very effective provided that the seed data used for adaptation is ‘close enough’ to the remaining text to be translated; otherwise, MT quality neither improves nor worsens, thus showing the robustness of our method. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Computer-assisted translation; Domain adaptation; Project adaptation; Self-tuning MT; Statistical machine translation","Computer assisted; Domain adaptation; Project adaptation; Selftuning; Statistical machine translation; Computational linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943014871

Since post-editing could be time consuming even more than the translation process, having a quality estimation of the translated parts can be very useful. It means we need to estimate the confidence of the output without having any references. Moreover, Confidence Estimation (CE) can be useful for some applications that their goal is to improve machine translation quality such as system combination, regenerating and pruning. But there is not yet any completely satisfactory method for CE task. We propose context vector-based features that are never used for CE task. We classify MT output at word level.

Common vocabulary words of morphologically rich languages typically have more than one morphological analyses. However, if a word contains multiple morphological alternatives, one of them is appropriate with respect to the context where the word is used. Different text processing tasks including rule-based Machine Translation (MT) require morphological features of each surface word-form of the sentence. Therefore, given a context, an efficient procedure is needed to choose the appropriate morphological analysis of each word having multiple alternatives. In this paper, we propose a method to identify correct morphological analysis of each Bengali word-form by cancelling (or pruning) all such analyses which show context incompatibility. © 2014 IEEE.","chunking; machine translation; morphological analysis; pruning; syntactic analysis","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Linguistics; Semantics; Syntactics; Text processing; Translation (languages); chunking; Machine translations; Morphological analysis; pruning; Syntactic analysis; Morphology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927667437

However, the use of syntactic information may have a negative impact on the speed of translation because of the large number of rules, especially when syntax labels are projected from a parser in syntax-augmented machine translation. In this paper, we propose a syntax-label clustering method that uses an exchange algorithm in which syntax labels are clustered together to reduce the number of rules. The proposed method achieves clustering by directly maximizing the likelihood of synchronous rules, whereas previous work considered only the similarity of probabilistic distributions of labels. We tested the proposed method on Japanese-English and Chinese-English translation tasks and found order-of-magnitude higher clustering speeds for reducing labels and gains in translation quality compared with previous clustering method. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Cluster analysis; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Natural language processing systems; Probability distributions; Clustering methods; Exchange algorithms; Machine translations; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical machine translation; Synchronous rules; Syntactic information; Translation quality; Syntactics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926052117

But their success has led to the presence of a broad range of brands and models, each one with its own and unique features, but also with its own environment for software development. This situation has some major drawbacks: it is very difficult to upgrade an installation by changing the PLC, maintenance costs rise with the multiplicity of PLC brands in a given factory, and production parameters must be changed when the production is changed to a machine with a different PLC. In this paper, a first step is presented to address such a situation: instead of developing the same program from scratch for each different PLC brand, a unique program is stored using the PLCopen XML standard. When the program must be ported to a given PLC, an automatic tool, the postprocessor, generates the final code that has to be downloaded to the target PLC.

We demonstrate the validity of the above claims by combining web-scale language models and large-scale error-corrected texts with parameter tuning according to the task metric and correction-specific features. Our system achieves a result of 35.0% F0.5 on the blind CoNLL-2014 test set, ranking on third place.

The objective is to evaluate the use of bilingual stem and suffix based features on the performance of the existing Support Vector Machine based classifier trained to classify the automatically extractedword-to-word translations.We initially induce the bilingual stem and suffix correspondences by considering the longest sequence common to orthogonally similar translations. Clusters of stem-pairs characterised by identical suffix-pairs are formed, which are then used to generate out-ofvocabulary translations that are identical to, but different from, the previously existing translations, thereby completing the existing lexicon. Using the bilingual stem and suffix correspondences induced from the augmented lexicon we come up with 5 new features that reflects the (non)existence of morphological coverage (agreement) between a term and its translation. Specifically, we examine and evaluate the use of suffix classes, bilingual stem and suffix correspondences as features in selecting correct word-toword translations from among the automatically extracted ones. With a training data of approximately 35.8K word translations for the language pair English-Portuguese, we identified around 6.4K unique stem pairs and 0.25K uniquesuffixpairs.Further, experimental results showthat the newly added features improvedtheword-to-word classification accuracyby 9.11% leading to an overall improvement in the classifier accuracy by 2.15% when all translations (single- and multi-word translations) were considered. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bilingual suffix classes; Lexicon augmentation; OOV terms; Support vector machine; Translation classification","Support vector machines; Bilingual suffix classes; Language pairs; Lexicon augmentation; Oov terms; Training data; Translation lexicons; Word classification; Word translation; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921659330

To reduce the search space, most previous approaches have tried to use heuristics to mine comparable documents. However, these heuristics are only available in few cases. Instead, we go on a different direction and adopt the cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) framework to find translation candidates directly at sentence level from comparable corpus. What’s more, for the sake of better retrieval result, two simple but effective query expansion methods are proposed. Experimental results show that using our query expansion methods can help to improve the recall significantly and obtain candidates of sentence pairs with high quality.

Furthermore, the model size increases exponentially when the n-gram order becomes higher and higher.

Further insight is provided into the role of the source text in post-editing, with results suggesting that consulting the source text is only associated with how cognitively demanding the task is perceived in the case of those with a low level of proficiency in the source language.

The needed computations in this model are organized as measurement patterns. Previously, an automatic approach to extract a 1WQC pattern from a quantum circuit has been proposed. It takes a quantum circuit consisting of CZ and J(α) gates and translates it into an optimized 1WQC pattern. However, the quantum synthesis algorithms usually decompose circuits using a library containing CNOT and any single-qubit gates. In this paper, we show how this approach can be modified in a way that it can take a circuit consisting of CNOT and any single-qubit gates to produce an optimized 1WQC pattern. The single-qubit gates are first automatically J-decomposed and then added to the measurement patterns. Moreover, a new optimization technique is proposed by presenting some algorithms to add Pauli gates to the measurement patterns directly, i.e., without their J-decomposition which leads to more compact patterns for these gates. Using these algorithms, an improved approach for adding single-qubit gates to measurement patterns is proposed. The optimized pattern of CNOT gates is directly added to the measurement patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can efficiently produce optimized patterns for quantum circuits and that adding CNOT gates directly to the measurement patterns decreases the translation runtime. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Measurement patterns; One-way quantum computations; Optimization; Quantum circuits","Logic circuits; Logic gates; Optimization; Quantum computers; State assignment; Automatic approaches; Automatic translation; Measurement patterns; One-way quantum computation; Optimization techniques; Quantum circuit; Qubit measurement; Single-qubit gates; Quantum entanglement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911954490

To select the best translation, our method is based on a correspondence measure between two semantic networks. The first one represents the senses of ambiguous terms of the query. The second one is a semantic network contextually enriched, representing the collection of sentences responding to the query. This collection forms the knowledge base of our disambiguation method and it is obtained by alignment with the relevant sentences in Arabic. The evaluation of the proposed system shows the advantage of the contextual enrichment on the quality of the translation. We obtained a high precision, relatively proportional to the precision provided by the used alignment. Finally, our translation demonstrates its potential by comparing its Bleu score with that of Google translate.","Automatic evaluation metrics; Contextual relations; Cross-language information retrieval systems; Lexical disambiguation; Machine translation; Matching; Semantic and conceptual indexing","Computational linguistics; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Linguistics; Quality control; Semantics; Translation (languages); Automatic evaluation; Conceptual indexing; Contextual relations; Cross language information retrieval; Lexical disambiguation; Machine translations; Matching; Search engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911490490

The main objective of this work is to investigate the applicability of these approaches for translating between programming languages. Towards that, we investigated several variants of the phrase-based translation approach: i) a direct application of the approach to programming languages, ii) a novel modification of the approach to incorporate the grammatical structure of the target programming language (so to avoid generating target programs which do not parse), and iii) a combination of ii) with custom rules added to improve the quality of the translation. To experiment with the above systems, we investigated machine translation from C# to Java. For the training, which takes about 60 hours, we used a parallel corpus of 20, 499 C#-to-Java method translations. We then evaluated each of the three systems above by translating 1, 000 C# methods. Our experimental results indicate that with the most advanced system, about 60% of the translated methods compile (the top ranked) and out of a random sample of 50 correctly compiled methods, 68% (34 methods) were semanti-cally equivalent to the reference solution.

We tackle two core issues that are central to query translation: how to exploit context to generate more accurate translations and how to preserve ambiguity that may be present in the original query, thereby retaining a diverse set of translation alternatives. These two considerations are often in tension since ambiguity in natural language is typically resolved by exploiting context, but effective retrieval requires striking the right balance. We propose two novel query translation approaches: the grammar-based approach extracts translation probabilities from translation grammars, while the decoder-based approach takes advantage of n-best translation hypotheses. Both are context-sensitive, in contrast to a baseline context-insensitive approach that uses bilingual dictionaries for word-by-word translation. Experimental results show that by ""opening up"" modern statistical machine translation systems, we can access intermediate representations that yield high retrieval effectiveness. By combining evidence from multiple sources, we demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines on standard cross-language information retrieval test collections. In addition to effectiveness, the efficiency of our techniques are explored as well. © 2014 ACM.",,"Cross language information retrieval; Statistical machine translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909957922

To solve this problem, several attempts have been initiated, each having the objective to obtain a better translation quality of the parallel corpora. But before the various ambiguities of the natural language, the problem of translation is far from easy to solve. To do this, and in order to increase the translation quality, we propose a model for the generation of different semantic cases relating to different components of the sentence to determine the meaning first and then generate the translation into the language target. This allowed us to obtain satisfactory results compared to similar studies using other techniques. In our approach, we used a model guided by the semantics to learn the techniques of translation with a similar human performance. Our project is to translate source sentences from Arabic to French through a statistical approach that includes a dictionary and that is automatically evaluated by the BLEU metric to ensure encouraging results even if the tools that we use are very limited. © 2014 IEEE.","alignment; parallel corpora; statistcal machine translation; statistical approach",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908675990

But AI research has contributed a huge amount of valuable technology, which has proved to be successful on narrow, specialized problems. Unfortunately, the field of AI has fragmented into those narrow specialties. Many researchers claim that their specialty is the key to solving all the problems. But the true key to AI is the knowledge that there is no key. Human intelligence comprises every specialty that anyone in any culture or civilization has ever dreamed of. Each one is adequate for a narrow range of applications. The power of human intelligence comes from the ability to relate, combine, and build on an open-ended variety of methods for different applications.

In this paper, we propose a method to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimation of reordering models. Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase, our method firstly uses a compact structure named reordering graph to represent all phrase segmentations of a parallel sentence, then the effect of the adjacent phrase number can be quantified in a forward-backward fashion, and finally incorporated into the estimation of reordering models.

Next, we add new translation rules for two components of the diagrams - junction and choice pseudostates - which have not been dealt with previously. Further, we are implementing the automatic translation system on a web-based model-driven development tool, which reflects on our translation rules.Originality/value - As the contribution of this work, more reasonable verification results for more general SysML state machine diagrams can be achieved.Purpose - This study aims to describe the behavior of blocks in the system under consideration using systems modeling language (SysML) state machine diagrams.

We compare three methods that involve human workers to highlight keywords in English-to-Chinese translations: English-only for adding keyword highlights on the original English sentences, Chinese-only for adding keyword highlights on the translated sentences, and Bilingual that allows people to choose keywords in either the original or the translated sentences. Results show that adding highlights to translated sentences (Chinese-only) is the fastest but doesn't improve the comprehensibility of translation.

However, for machine translation (MT) systems, due to its complexity and knowledge dependency, such diagnostic evaluation often demands a large amount of manual work. To tackle this problem, we propose an automatic diagnostic evaluation methodology, called Woodpecker, which enables multi-factored evaluation of MT systems based on linguistic categories and automatically constructed linguistic checkpoints. The taxonomy of the categories is defined with rich linguistic knowledge, including phenomena on different linguistic levels. The instances of the categories are composed into test cases called linguistic checkpoints. We present a method that automatically extracts checkpoints from parallel sentences, through which, Woodpecker can automatically monitor a MT system in translating various linguistic phenomena, thereby facilitating diagnostic evaluation. The effectiveness of Woodpecker is verified through in-house experiments and open MT evaluation tracks on various types of MT systems.","Checkpoint; Diagnosis; Evaluation; Linguistic knowledge; Machine translation","Computational linguistics; Diagnosis; Artificial intelligence systems; Automatic diagnostics; Checkpoint; Evaluation; Evaluation methodologies; Linguistic knowledge; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906977352

We investigate whether the same approach would be equally successful regardless of the type of simplification we wish to learn (given that different target audiences require different levels of simplification). Our preliminary results indicate that the standard PB-SMT model might not be able to learn the strong simplifications which are needed for certain users, e.g. people with Down's syndrome.

Establishing the validity of these transformations is crucial to ensure that the intended behaviour of a system has not been faultily altered during synthesis. Finite state machines with datapath (FSMDs) have traditionally been used to model the specification and the implementation. Path based equivalence checkers over this model have been proposed to validate the translation process. Since specification for digital systems implementing algorithmic computations over integers involves the whole of integer arithmetic which is undecidable, majority of these equivalence checkers employ a normalization technique that tries to reduce two computationally equivalent expressions e1 and e2 to a syntactically identical form. This normalization technique, however, is not applicable to reason over finite precision datatypes. In this work, we propose to augment the normalization module, wherever necessary, with an SMT solver to determine the validity of e1= e2. The scope of translation validation can be extended to handle bit-vectors, user-defined datatypes and more sophisticated transformations by leveraging the capability of SMT solvers while keeping the basic equivalence checking framework intact. We have explored three state-of-the-art SMT solvers namely, Yices2, CVC4 and Z3. The experiments demonstrate improvement in terms of its scope of application over the existing methodology. © 2014 IEEE.","Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD); Normalization; SMT Solvers; Translation Validation","Embedded systems; Finite automata; Specifications; Behavioural specifications; Data paths; Equivalence checking; Equivalent expression; Normalization; Scope of application; Smt solvers; Translation validation; Model checking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906708180

In ordinary languages the most frequent Action verbs are ""general"", since they extend productively to actions belonging to different ontological types. Moreover, each language categorizes action in its own way and therefore the cross-linguistic reference to everyday activities is puzzling.

It determines an optimal local similarity measure of a query time series Q and a subject time series S. The measure is invariant under both local deformation on the measurementaxis and scaling in the time domain.

For translation, it simplifies any form (i.e. simple, complex, compound, active and passive form) of English sentence into the simplest form of English sentence i.e. subject plus verb plus object. When compared with existing rule based EtoB MT schemes, VBMT doesn't employ exclusive or individual structural rules of various English sentences; it only detects the main verb from any form of English sentence and then transforms it into the simplest form of English sentence. Thus VBMT can translate from EtoB very simply, correctly and efficiently. Rule based EtoB MT is tough because it requires the matching of sentences with the stored rules. Moreover, many existing EtoB MT schemes which deploy rules are almost inefficient to translate complex or complicated sentences because it is difficult to match them with well-established rules of English grammar. VBMT is efficient because after identifying the main verb of any form of English sentence, it binds the remaining parts of speech (POS) as subject and object. VBMT has been successfully implemented for the MT of Assertive, Interrogative, Imperative, Exclamatory, Active-Passive, Simple, Complex, and Compound form of English sentences applicable in both desktop and mobile applications. © 2014 IEEE.","English to Bangla; Human Language Technology; Natural Language Processing; Rule based Machine Translation","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Information science; English sentences; English to Bangla; Human language technologies; Machine translations; Mobile applications; NAtural language processing; Rule-based machine translations; Structural rules; Natural language processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904985362

A formal description of locative groups faces several problems. The first is the definition of locative semantic relations between words, as locative dependencies can have different meanings, such as the meanings of initial and final points (walk [from/to the door]), route (walk [across the room]), and others. Second, one has to define the set of words that can fill locative adjuncts, and the border between the locative and non-locative groups is not always distinct: in the street is definitely a locative, but what about on the Internet or in a meeting? Third, the syntactic realizations of locative senses are rather numerous. On the one hand, locative adjuncts include many prepositions with different semantics-like on, in, under, above, etc. On the other hand, different nouns combine with different prepositions to denote the same meaning, like in the country, but on the island. The current paper suggests a formal approach appropriate for dealing with all these difficulties.","Locative dependencies; Machine translation; NLP; Semantics; Syntax",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904806858

One of the most intricate problems for machine translation is grammatical aspect in Russian when it has to be translated into a language either lacking aspect or having a different aspect system. On the categorical level, aspect has only approximate equivalents in non-Slavic languages, such as the progressive form in English, for instance. In addition, language-internally, its semantics and interpretation cannot be sufficiently captured with only one specific characteristic feature. In this paper, we aim at establishing a basis for the machine translation of the Russian aspect. To do so, we discuss an approach to describe the interaction of verb and aspect semantics in a systematic way. Moreover, we describe a possible annotation for the aspectual information that is provided by further lexical components contributing to the meaning computation. This allows for the formulation of rules for machine translation into target languages where the grammatical category of aspect is realized differently or not present at all.","Ambiguity; English; German; Grammatical aspect; Machine translation; Russian; Semantic/ syntactic features; Turkish",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904803527

The extraction of possible translations is based on statistical machine translation methods. The selection of lemmatized and linguistically motivated phrases is done with the help of morpho-syntactic analysis. In contrast to humanbuilt dictionaries, an automatic dictionary usually contains a certain amount of noisy translations, as a consequence of systematic alignment mistakes and corpus imperfections.

However, when using syntax for both languages (""tree-to-tree"" translation), there is evidence that syntactic divergence can hamper the extraction of useful rules (Ding and Palmer 2005). Smith and Eisner (2006) introduced quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that treats non-isomorphic structure softly using features rather than hard constraints. Although a natural fit for translation modeling, its flexibility has proved challenging for building real-world systems. In this article, we present a tree-to-tree machine translation system inspired by quasi-synchronous grammar. The core of our approach is a new model that combines phrases and dependency syntax, integrating the advantages of phrase-based and syntax-based translation.

Machine translation (MT) supports multilingual communication; however, it cannot achieve high accuracy. MT creates only one translated sentence; therefore, it is difficult to improve the accuracy of translated sentences. Our method creates multiple translations by adding personal pronouns to the source sentence and by using a word dictionary and a parallel corpus. In addition, it selects an accurate translation from among the multiple translations using the results of a Web search. As a result, the translation repair method improved the accuracy of translated sentences, and its accuracy is greater than that of MT.

Yet, the ever-growing amount of data in different languages on the Web renders multi-lingual support increasingly important. In this paper, we assess various methods for supporting an additional target language in lexicon-based sentiment analysis. As a baseline, we automatically translate text into a reference language for which a sentiment lexicon is available, and subsequently analyze the translated text. Second, we consider mapping sentiment scores from a semantically enabled sentiment lexicon in the reference language to a new target sentiment lexicon, by traversing relations between language-specific semantic lexicons. Last, we consider creating a target sentiment lexicon by propagating sentiment of seed words in a semantic lexicon for the target language. When extending sentiment analysis from English to Dutch, mapping sentiment across languages by exploiting relations between semantic lexicons yields a significant performance improvement over the baseline of about 29% in terms of accuracy and macro-level F1 on our data. Propagating sentiment in language-specific semantic lexicons can outperform the baseline by up to about 47%, depending on the seed set of sentiment-carrying words. This indicates that sentiment is not only linked to word meanings, but tends to have a language-specific dimension as well. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Lexicon; Machine translation; Map; Multi-lingual sentiment analysis; Propagation; Semantics","Computer aided language translation; Mapping; Maps; Sentiment analysis; Wave propagation; Lexicon; Machine translations; Semantic lexicon; Sentiment lexicons; Sentiment scores; Specific languages; Specific semantics; Target language; Semantics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900557355

In the case of machine translation (MT) mediated collaborations, however, the absence or presence of MT is not obvious. English sentences with poor grammar can result from both a partner's lack of fluency and errors in the MT process. We hypothesize that partners' attributions about the source of the errors affects their collaboration experience. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which monolingual native English speaking participants collaborated with bilingual native-Mandarin speakers on a map navigation task. Participants were randomly assigned into a 2 (beliefs about MT: absence vs. presence) by 2 (actual mediation of MT: absence vs. presence) experiment design.

In this paper we explore the use of conjoint analysis as a formal quantitative framework to assess users' relative preferences for different types of translation errors. We apply our approach to the analysis of MT output from translating public health documents from English into Spanish. Our results indicate that word order errors are clearly the most dispreferred error type, followed by word sense, morphological, and function word errors. The conjoint analysis-based model is able to predict user preferences more accurately than a baseline model that chooses the translation with the fewest errors overall. Additionally we analyze the effect of using a crowd-sourced respondent population versus a sample of domain experts and observe that main preference effects are remarkably stable across the two samples. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Evaluation; Machine translation; Preference elicitation; User modeling","Computer aided language translation; Statistical methods; Baseline models; Conjoint analysis; Evaluation; Machine translations; Preference elicitation; Quantitative frameworks; User Modeling; Word order errors; Errors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897388865

In this context, one is given (a) a synchronous grammar that describes the translation from one language into another and (b) a recognizable set of trees; the aim is to construct a finite representation of the set of those derivations that derive elements from the given set, either on the source side (input restriction) or on the target side (output restriction). In tree-adjoining machine translation the grammar is a kind of synchronous tree-adjoining grammar. For this case, only partial solutions to the tree parsing problem have been described, some being restricted to the unweighted case, some to the monolingual case. We introduce a class of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars which is effectively closed under input and output restrictions to weighted regular tree languages, i.e. the restricted translations can again be represented by grammars in the same class; this enables, e.g. cascading restrictions. Moreover, we present an algorithm that constructs these grammars for input and output restriction. © 2012 The Author, 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance.

Huge effort is being invested in improving n-gram language models. By introducing external information (morphology, syntax, partitioning into documents, etc.) into the models a significant improvement can be achieved. The models can however be improved with no external information and smoothing is an excellent example of such an improvement. In this article we show another way of improving the models that also requires no external information. We examine patterns that can be found in large corpora by building semantic spaces (HAL, COALS, BEAGLE and others described in this article). These semantic spaces have never been tested in language modeling before. Our method uses semantic spaces and clustering to build classes for a class-based language model. The class-based model is then coupled with a standard n-gram model to create a very effective language model. Our experiments show that our models reduce the perplexity and improve the accuracy of n-gram language models with no external information added. Training of our models is fully unsupervised. Our models are very effective for inflectional languages, which are particularly hard to model. We show results for five different semantic spaces with different settings and different number of classes. The perplexity tests are accompanied with machine translation tests that prove the ability of proposed models to improve performance of a real-world application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","BEAGLE; Class-based language models; Clustering Inflectional languages; COALS; HAL; Machine translation; Purandare and Pedersen; Random Indexing; Semantic spaces","BEAGLE; Class-based language model; HAL; Machine translations; Purandare and Pedersen; Random indexing; Semantic Space; Coal; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Semantics; Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885425676

In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (subsequent position; SP) given the last translated source word position (current position; CP). We propose a distortion model that can simultaneously consider the word at the CP, the word at an SP candidate, the context of the CP and an SP candidate, relative word order among the SP candidates, and the words between the CP and an SP candidate. These considered elements are called rich context. Our model considers rich context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to each SP candidate. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among SP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In contrast to the learning strategy of existing methods, our learning strategy is that the model learns preference relations among SP candidates in each sentence of the training data. This leaning strategy enables consideration of all of the rich context simultaneously. In our experiments, our model had higher BLUE and RIBES scores for Japanese-English, Chinese-English, and German-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models. © 2014 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).","Distortion model; Machine translation; Reordering","Distortion model; Learning strategy; Machine translations; Phrase-based statistical machine translation; Preference relation; Reordering; Reordering models; Statistical machine translation; Learning systems; Linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897674721

To be successfully embedded in real-world applications, it must compensate for its imperfections by interacting intelligently with the user within a computer-assisted translation framework. The interactive-predictive paradigm, where both a statistical translation model and a human expert collaborate to generate the translation, has been shown to be an effective computer-assisted translation approach. However, the exhaustive supervision of all translations and the use of non-incremental translation models penalizes the productivity of conventional interactive-predictive systems. We propose a cost-sensitive active learning framework for computer-assisted translation whose goal is to make the translation process as painless as possible. In contrast to conventional active learning scenarios, the proposed active learning framework is designed to minimize not only how many translations the user must supervise but also how difficult each translation is to supervise. To do that, we address the two potential drawbacks of the interactive-predictive translation paradigm. On the one hand, user effort is focused to those translations whose user supervision is considered more ""informative"", thus, maximizing the utility of each user interaction. On the other hand, we use a dynamic machine translation model that is continually updated with user feedback after deployment. We empirically validated each of the technical components in simulation and quantify the user effort saved. We conclude that both selective translation supervision and translation model updating lead to important user-effort reductions, and consequently to improved translation productivity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, test generation techniques based on model checking have been reported to bridge this gap. To evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques, an in-house tool suite, AutoMOTGen, has been developed for Simulink/Stateflow and applied on real-life case studies at General Motors. This paper outlines the test generation methodology of AutoMOTGen and gives a comparative study with a commercial, primarily random input-based, test generation tool on the same set of examples. The results indicate that in terms of coverage, model checking-based techniques complement the random input-based techniques. In addition, they provide proofs for unreachability that can aid in debugging the models. Therefore, it is recommended that model checking-based tools be utilized to complement and enhance the effectiveness of model-based testing methods in safety-critical systems engineering.

In particular in case of low-resource languages, it is difficult to find an existing parallel corpus which is large enough for building a real statistical machine translation. However, comparable non-parallel corpora are richly available in the Internet environment, such as in Wikipedia, and from which we can extract valuable parallel texts. This work presents a framework for effectively extracting parallel sentences from that resource, which results in significantly improving the performance of statistical machine translation systems. Our framework is a bootstrapping-based method that is strengthened by using a new measurement for estimating the similarity between two bilingual sentences. We conduct experiment for the language pair of English and Vietnamese and obtain promising results on both constructing parallel corpora and improving the accuracy of machine translation from English to Vietnamese.","non-parallel comparable corpora; Parallel sentence extraction; statistical machine translation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894583877

Like IR, in CLIR for a particular information need, we have to find relevant information or documents containing such information. In CLIR multiple tools must be developed to match terms containing same meaning in different languages. The usual solution is to translate the query and/or the documents before performing the search. So translation is pivotal activity in CLIR. In CLIR a wide range of techniques were proposed in the literature for translation.

But Hiero typically uses the CKY decoding algorithm which requires the entire input sentence before decoding begins, as it produces the translation in a bottom-up fashion. Left-to-right (LR) decoding [2] is a promising decoding algorithm for Hiero that produces the output translation in left to right order. In this paper we focus on simultaneous translation using the Hiero translation framework. In simultaneous translation, translations are generated incrementally as source language speech input is processed. We propose a novel approach for incremental translation by integrating segmentation and decoding in LR-Hiero.

Machine translation is increasingly used to support multilingual communication. In the traditional, transparent-channel way of using machine translation for the multilingual communication, translation errors are ignorable, due to the quality limitation of current machine translators. Those translation errors will break the communication and lead to miscommunication. We propose to shift the paradigm from the transparent-channel metaphor to the human-interpreter metaphor, which motives the interactions between the users and the machine translator. Following this paradigm shifting, the interpreter (agent) encourages the dialog participants to collaborate, as their interactivity will be helpful in reducing the number of translation errors, the noise of the channel. We examine the translation issues raised by multilingual communication, and analyze the impact of interactivity on the elimination of translation errors. We propose an implementation of the agent metaphor, which promotes interactivity between dialog participants and the machine translator. We design the architecture of our agent, analyze the interaction process, describe decision support and autonomous behavior, and provide an example of preparing repair strategy. We conduct an English-Chinese communication task experiment on tangram arrangement. The experiment shows that compared to the transparent-channel metaphor, our agent metaphor reduces human communication effort by 21.6%.","Interactivity; Language Service; Machine Translation Mediated Communication; Multilingual Communication; Translation Repair Strategy","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Decision support systems; Errors; Repair; Interactivity; Language Service; Mediated Communication; Multilingual communications; Repair strategy; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903603665

This paper adapts and investigates the paradigm of robust learning to learning languages from positive data. Broadening the scope of that paradigm is important: robustness captures a form of invariance of learnability under admissible transformations on the object of study; hence, it is a very desirable property. The key to defining robust learning of languages is to impose that the latter be automatic, that is, recognisable by a finite automaton. The invariance property used to capture robustness can then naturally be defined in terms of first-order definable operators, called translators. For several learning criteria amongst a selection of learning criteria investigated either in the literature on explanatory learning from positive data or in the literature on query learning, we characterise the classes of languages all of whose translations are learnable under that criterion. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Automatic structures; Inductive inference; Learning in the limit; Query learning; Robust learning; Translations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894030207

General-purpose PDA algorithms for replacement, composition, shortest path, and expansion are presented. We describe HiPDT, a hierarchical phrase-based decoder using the PDA representation and these algorithms.We contrast the complexity of this decoder with a decoder based on a finite state automata representation, showing that PDAs provide a more suitable framework to achieve exact decoding for larger synchronous context-free grammars and smaller language models. We assess this experimentally on a large-scale Chinese-to-English alignment and translation task. In translation, we propose a two-pass decoding strategy involving a weaker language model in the first-pass to address the results of PDA complexity analysis.

Even when dealing with closely-related language pairs, statistical machine translation encounters problems if the parallel corpus is not big enough. To reduce the problem of data sparsity, we use the approach called factored translation, which has proven successful when translating between English and a morphologically rich language. We show that it is even more useful when translating between two highly inflected languages. The main contribution of the paper involves two extensions of the factored translation approach. First, we propose a new, more general asynchronous framework for training translation components, where lemmas in the lemma component and MSD tags in the MSD component are aligned independently of alignment done for surface word forms. The second contribution of the paper is a new technique for efficient use of a bilingual dictionary in the translation process. A dictionary is introduced into the lemma component to improve lexical translation. Dictionary use is based on entropy. We tested our enhanced translation approach on the Slovenian-Serbian language pair. The system was trained on a freely available OpenSubtitle corpus. The results show improvements in automatic scores (BLEU and TER). The approach could be used for other language pairs, especially if one or both are highly inflected.","Bilingual dictionary; Entropy; Highly inflected languages; Phrase-based translation; Statistical machine translation","Entropy; Linguistics; Asynchronous framework; Bilingual dictionary; Data sparsity; Language pairs; Parallel corpora; Statistical machine translation; Translation process; Translation (languages)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903128696

Since patents often appear in different languages, cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an essential component of effective patent search. In recent years machine translation (MT) has become the dominant approach to translation in CLIR. Standard MT systems focus on generating proper translations that are morphologically and syntactically correct. Development of effective MT systems of this type requires large training resources and high computational power for training and translation. This is an important issue for patent CLIR where queries are typically very long sometimes taking the form of a full patent application, meaning that query translation using MT systems can be very slow. However, in contrast to MT, the focus for information retrieval (IR) is on the conceptual meaning of the search words regardless of their surface form, or the linguistic structure of the output. Thus much of the complexity of MT is not required for effective CLIR. We present an adapted MT technique specifically designed for CLIR. In this method IR text pre-processing in the form of stop word removal and stemming are applied to the MT training corpus prior to the training phase. Applying this step leads to a significant decrease in the MT computational and training resources requirements. Experimental application of the new approach to the cross language patent retrieval task from CLEF-IP 2010 shows that the new technique to be up to 23 times faster than standard MT for query translations, while maintaining IR effectiveness statistically indistinguishable from standard MT when large training resources are used. Furthermore the new method is significantly better than standard MT when only limited translation training resources are available, which can be a significant issue for translation in specialized domains. The new MT technique also enables patent document translation in a practical amount of time with a resulting significant improvement in the retrieval effectiveness. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cross-language information retrieval; Cross-language patent retrieval; Large-data CLIR; Machine translation; Prior-art Patent search",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943588649

The Korean language is morphologically rich and needs complicated processing for morphological analysis. In general, three basic operations are needed for Korean morphological analysis: morpheme restoration, morpheme segmentation, and morpheme tagging. A variety of methods have been developed using the combinations of these three basic operations. In this paper, we define three syllable-based probabilistic models for Korean morphological analysis, and compare the models by implementing them with a cascading statistical machine translation (SMT) tool and a conditional random fields (CRFs) tool. The lexical forms of morphemes are restored by an SMT model, the morpheme sequences are segmented into each unit, and the part-of-speech tags are attached to each unit by CRFs models. For the integration, we used the beam search method, which involved rescaling the output ranks and probabilities originated by the different tools. An experiment with the Sejong tagged corpus showed that the joint model (two-step model) performed best, achieving 98.23% in the 10-best recall. The rescaling method also contributed to the improved performance. © 2014 International Information Institute.","Conditional random fields; CRF++; Korean morphological analysis; Moses; Statistical machine translation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921726776

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to shed light on some of the techniques that employ machine translation available in literature, to encourage researchers to study these techniques. We discuss some of the linguistic characteristics of the Arabic language. Features of Arabic that are related to machine translation are discussed in detail, along with possible difficulties that they might present.

Here we investigate the embeddings learned by neural machine translation models, a recently-developed class of neural language model. We show that embeddings from translation models outperform those learned by monolingual models at tasks that require knowledge of both conceptual similarity and lexical-syntactic role. We further show that these effects hold when translating from both English to French and English to German, and argue that the desirable properties of translation embeddings should emerge largely independently of the source and target languages. Finally, we apply a new method for training neural translation models with very large vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion algorithm results in minimal degradation of embedding quality. Our embedding spaces can be queried in an online demo and downloaded from our web page. Overall, our analyses indicate that translation-based embeddings should be used in applications that require concepts to be organised according to similarity and/or lexical function, while monolingual embeddings are better suited to modelling (nonspecific) inter-word relatedness. © 2015 International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR.

We find that MERT learns the tuning set verbosity very well, while PRO is sensitive to both the verbosity and the length of the source sentences in the tuning set; yet, overall PRO learns best from high-verbosity tuning datasets.

Using the MT system, the sentences in the source-language corpus are translated in all possible ways according to the different translation equivalents in the bilingual dictionary of the system. These translations are then scored on the target-language model and the scores are normalised to provide fractional counts for training source-language maximum-entropy lexical-selection models.

Analyzing the output of English to Persian machine translation systems illustrates that Persian morphology comes with many challenges especially in the verb conjugation. In this paper, we investigate three ways to deal with the morphology of Persian verb in machine translation (MT): no morphology generation in statistical MT, rule-based morphology generation in rule-based MT and a hybrid-model-independent morphology generation. By model-independent we mean that it is not based on statistical or rule-based MT and could be applied to any English to Persian MT as a post-processor. We select Google translator (translate.google.com) to show the performance of a statistical MT without any morphology generation component for the verb conjugation. Rule-based morphology generation is implemented as a part of a rule-based MT. Finally, we enrich the rule-based approach by statistical methods and information to present a hybrid model. A set of linguistically motivated features are defined using both English and Persian linguistic knowledge obtained from a parallel corpus. Then we make a model to predict six morphological features of the verb in Persian using decision tree classifier and generate an inflected verb form. In a real translation process, by applying our model to the output of Google translator and a rule-based MT as a post-processor, we achieve an improvement of about 0.7% absolute BLEU score in the best case.

This complementarity has, over the last few years, resulted in the consolidation of a growing interest in hybrid systems that combine both data-driven and linguistic approaches. In this paper, we address the situation in which the amount of bilingual resources that is available for a particular language pair is not sufficiently large to train a competitive statistical MT system, but the cost and slow development cycles of rule-based MT systems cannot be afforded either. In this context, we formalise a new method that uses scarce parallel corpora to automatically infer a set of shallow-transfer rules to be integrated into a rule-based MT system, thus avoiding the need for human experts to handcraft these rules. Our work is based on the alignment template approach to phrase-based statistical MT, but the definition of the alignment template is extended to encompass different generalisation levels. It is also greatly inspired by the work of Sánchez-Martínez and Forcada (2009) in which alignment templates were also considered for shallow-transfer rule inference. However, our approach overcomes many relevant limitations of that work, principally those related to the inability to find the correct generalisation level for the alignment templates, and to select the subset of alignment templates that ensures an adequate segmentation of the input sentences by the rules eventually obtained. Unlike previous approaches in literature, our formalism does not require linguistic knowledge about the languages involved in the translation. Moreover, it is the first time that conflicts between rules are resolved by choosing the most appropriate ones according to a global minimisation function rather than proceeding in a pairwise greedy fashion. Experiments conducted using five different language pairs with the free/open-source rule-based MT platform Apertium show that translation quality significantly improves when compared to the method proposed by Sánchez-Martínez and Forcada (2009), and is close to that obtained using handcrafted rules. For some language pairs, our approach is even able to outperform them. Moreover, the resulting number of rules is considerably smaller, which eases human revision and maintenance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid machine translation; Machine translation; Transfer rule inference","Computational linguistics; Hybrid systems; Natural language processing systems; Bilingual resources; Development cycle; Hybrid machine translation; Linguistic approach; Linguistic knowledge; Machine translations; Transfer rules; Translation quality; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027937891

We train monolingual and bilingual word vector models on large corpora and we evaluate them first in a cross-lingual lexical substitution task and then on the final translation task. For translation, we incorporate the semantic information in a statistical document-level decoder (Docent), by enforcing translation choices that are semantically similar to the context. As expected, the bilingual word vector models are more appropriate for the purpose of translation. The final document-level translator incorporating the semantic model outperforms the basic Docent (without semantics) and also performs slightly over a standard sentence-level SMT system in terms of ULC (the average of a set of standard automatic evaluation metrics for MT).

Today one can find several machine translation systems on the web that provide reasonable translations, although the systems are not perfect. In some specific domains, the quality may decrease. A recently proposed approach to this domain is neural machine translation. It aims at building a jointly-tuned single neural network that maximizes translation performance, a very different approach from traditional statistical machine translation. Recently proposed neural machine translation models often belong to the encoder-decoder family in which a source sentence is encoded into a fixed length vector that is, in turn, decoded to generate a translation. The present research examines the effects of different training methods on a Polish-English Machine Translation system used for medical data. The European Medicines Agency parallel text corpus was used as the basis for training of neural and statistical network-based translation systems. The main machine translation evaluation metrics have also been used in analysis of the systems.

While machine translation from Japanese is particularly challenging because of its structural uniqueness, the state of the art in the field generally is such that poor output is a universal problem. The solution we propose draws on recent advances in controlled authoring, document structuring and machine translation evaluation. It is realised as a prototype tool that enables non-professional writers to create documents where individual sentences and overall flow are both clear. The tool is designed to enhance machine-translatability into English without compromising the readability of the Japanese original. The originality of the tool is to provide an interactive sentence checker that is context-sensitive to the individual functional elements of a document template specialised for the public administration domain. Where natural Japanese sentences give bad translation results, we pre-process them internally into a form which yields acceptable machine translation output. Evaluation of the tool will target three concerns: its usability by non-professional authors; the acceptability of the Japanese document; and the comprehensibility of the English translation. We suggest that such an authoring framework could facilitate government communication with citizens in many societies beyond Japan. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Authoring tool; Controlled language; Dita; Document structure; Government communication; Machine translation","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Public administration; Websites; Authoring tool; Controlled language; Dita; Document structure; Government communication; Machine translations; Translation (languages)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960435966

One extremely effective method for estimating the model parameters is minimum error rate training (MERT), which is an efficient form of line optimisation adapted to the highly nonlinear objective functions used in machine translation. We describe a polynomial-time generalisation of line optimisation that computes the error surface over a plane embedded in parameter space. The description of this algorithm relies on convex geometry, which is the mathematics of polytopes and their faces. Using this geometric representation of MERT we investigate whether the optimisation of linear models is tractable in general. Previous work on finding optimal solutions in MERT (Galley and Quirk, 2011) established a worstcase complexity that was exponential in the number of sentences, in contrast we show that exponential dependence in the worst-case complexity is mainly in the number of features. Although our work is framed with respect to MERT, the convex geometric description is also applicable to other error-based training methods for linear models. We believe our analysis has important ramifications because it suggests that the current trend in building statistical machine translation systems by introducing a very large number of sparse features is inherently not robust. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computational linguistics; Errors; Geometry; Polynomial approximation; Exponential dependence; Geometric description; Geometric representation; Minimum error rate trainings; Nonlinear objective functions; Statistical machine translation; Statistical machine translation system; Worst-case complexity; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960083415

We also introduce a random walk style algorithm to collectively identify translations of sourceside content words that are strongly related in translation graph.

However, the case of a floating quantifier in an infinitive clause varies according to the type of PRO control applied and some other structural characteristics of the infinitive clause. This poses a problem for rule-based machine translation, to choose the correct case for the quantifier at synthesis, or to link it correctly to its antecedent at analysis. A model-based machine translation system, such as ABBY Y Compreno, can handle the case choice problem, as this paper is to show.","Case marking; Floating quantifiers; Machine translation; PRO; Russian; Semipradicatives; Subject",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952791150

Most of these architecture constraints are formalized as “gross” specifications, without any structure or parameterization possibilities. This causes difficulties in their reuse. We propose in this work a process for translating architecture constraints into a special kind of components called constraint-components. This makes these specifications reusable (easily put and checked out in/from repositories), parametrizable (generic and applicable in different contexts) and composable with others. We implemented this process by considering the translation of OCL constraints into constraint-components described with an ADL called CLACS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Architecture constraint; Automatic translation; CLACS; Constraint-component; OCL definition; Reusability; UML metamodel","Reusability; Software architecture; Unified Modeling Language; Automatic translation; CLACS; Constraint-component; OCL definition; UML metamodel; Specifications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951083966

To further improve the efficiency, there is an increasing interest in applying the machine translation (MT) technology to upgrade CAT. Post-editing is a standard approach: human translators generate the translation by correcting MT outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach deeply integrating MT into CAT systems: a well-designed input method which makes full use of the knowledge adopted by MT systems, such as translation rules, decoding hypotheses and n-best translation lists. Our proposed approach allows human translators to focus on choosing better translation results with less time rather than just complete translation themselves. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method saves more than 14% time and over 33% keystrokes, and it improves the translation quality as well by more than 3 absolute BLEU scores compared with the strong baseline, i.e., post-editing using Google Pinyin.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer-aided translations; Input methods; Integrating machines; Language translation; Machine translations; Post-editing; Translation quality; Translation rules; Computer aided language translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949796391

In this paper, firstly, we describe the basic functions and realization mechanisms of MOT tools, and then we analyze 10 factors which should be considered in the evaluation of MOT tools, on the basis of the analyses, we propose the Delphi-based evaluation method with a relatively complete indicator system, and we also determine the weights of every indicator by using Delphi.

With the rapid development of multi-core technology, it is desirable to build a high-performance multi-core emulator rather than conventional single core emulator. However, current mainstream cross-ISA full-system emulator can only work sequentially, which seriously confines the parallelism. In order to take the advantage of parallelism of host platform to emulate multi processor architecture, this paper presents XE-MU, a cross-ISA full-system emulator on multiple processor architectures. Firstly, efficient methods are targeted to translate atomic instructions. Secondly, we study the approach to emulation of communications for inter-core and core-to-I/O devices. For the implementation, we utilise both GCC built-in-functions and LL/SC instructions-based methods to translate the atomic instructions. We propose a portable and efficient lock-free queue implementation for communications in virtual machine. In order to verify the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted experiments on the Loongson-3A hardware platform. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods are able to enhance the performance of the emulator and reduce the overhead of inter-core communication with interrupts; thereby, the efficiency of the emulator can be greatly improved. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Dynamic binary translation; Full-system emulator; Lock free buffer; Virtual machines","Architecture; Locks (fasteners); Network security; Parallel processing systems; Virtual machine; Built-in functions; Dynamic binary translation; Full-system emulator; Instruction set architecture; Inter-core communications; Lock-free; Multi processor architecture; Multiple processors; Computer architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946916834

The area of interest here is a Rule Based machine translation system that translates text from English to Malayalam using transfer approach. The system is designed to translate sentences from cricket domain related articles. The purpose behind making the system domain specific is to improve translation quality of sentences in the chosen domain. Our system depends on Stanford parser in the preprocessing stage. The input English sentence is tokenized, and parsed with the help of Stanford parser, and a parse tree is generated. According to the rules structured for the target language the source parse tree is reordered to produce the target parse tree. The words in target tree are mapped with bilingual English - Malayalam dictionary to obtain output Malayalam words. The system also maintains a separate verb dictionary that holds English verb in root form and its Malayalam meaning with 9 different inflections. Morphological generation phase provides necessary inflections for Malayalam words and thereby creates meaningful translations. The domain specific translation system was able to achieve correct translation results for about 86% of test sets. © 2015 IEEE.","domain specific RBMT; machine translation; transfer rules","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Forestry; Information science; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Syntactics; Domain specific; Domain-specific translation; Machine translation systems; Machine translations; Natural languages; Rule-based machine translations; Transfer rules; Translation quality; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946227635

The XTAG project has contributed a very comprehensive TAG for English Language. Although TAGs have been proposed nearly 40 years ago by Joshi et al, 1975, their usage and application in the Indian Languages have been very rare, predominantly due to their complexity and lack of resources. In this paper we discuss a new TAG system and methodology of development for Tamil Language that can be extended for other Indian languages. The trees are developed synchronously with a minimalistic grammar obtained by careful pruning of XTAG English Grammar. We also apply Chomskian minimalism on these TAG trees, so as to make them simple and easily parsable. Furthermore we have also developed a parser that can parse simple sentences using the above mentioned grammar, and generating a TAG derivation that can be used for dependency resolution. Due to the synchronous nature of these TAG pairs they can be readily adapted for Formalism based Machine Translation (MT) from English to Tamil and vice versa. © 2015 IEEE.","formalism; machine translation; parsing; synchronised grammar; transfer grammar; tree adjoining grammar","Computational grammars; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Context sensitive grammars; Forestry; Information science; Semantics; Syntactics; Translation (languages); formalism; Machine translations; parsing; synchronised grammar; transfer grammar; Tree adjoining grammars; Formal languages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946201673

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT'14 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.

Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on its problems recently, and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, major approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings. Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting based, and Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include: PRank, OC SVM, McRank, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, LambdaRank, LambdaMART, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed. © 2011 by Morgan & Claypool.","collaborative filtering; information retrieval; learning to rank; machine translation; natural language processing; ranking; ranking aggregation; ranking creation; supervised learning; web search","Collaborative filtering; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data handling; Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Supervised learning; Websites; Learning to rank; Machine translations; ranking; Ranking aggregation; ranking creation; Web searches; Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943760329

In this paper, we propose a method based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to match, and in some cases outperform, the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models.

Although the quality of free online automatic translation systems is not perfect, it is important to assure acceptable quality. As human evaluation is time-consuming, expensive and subjective, automatic quality evaluation metrics try to approach and approximate human evaluation as much as possible. In this paper, several automatic quality metrics will be utilised, in order to assess the quality of specific machine translated text. Namely, the research is performed on sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain, resulting from the digitisation process of a scientific publication written in Croatian and English. The quality evaluation results are discussed and further analysis is proposed. © 2015 AISTI.","automatic quality evaluation; BLEU; Croatian-English; English-Croatian; GTM; machine translation; METEOR; NIST; sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Information systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Philosophical aspects; Translation (languages); BLEU; Croatians; GTM; Machine translations; METEOR; NIST; Quality evaluation; sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943338807

Given two texts, one is called the “Text” denoted as T and the other one is called “Hypothesis” denoted as H, the process of textual entailment is to decide whether or not the meaning of H can be logically inferred from the meaning of T. Different semantic, lexical and vector based similarity metrics are used as features for different machine learning classifiers to take the entailment decision in this study. We also considered two machine translation evaluation metrics, namely BLEU and METEOR, as similarity metrics for this task. We carried out the experiments on the datasets released in the shared tasks on textual entailment organized in RTE-1, RTE-2, and RTE-3. We experimented with different feature combinations.

Thus, automatic evaluation is typically approached by measuring some sort of similarity between machine and human translations. Most widely used evaluation systems calculate similarity at surface level, for example, by computing the number of shared word n-grams. The correlation between automatic and manual evaluation scores at sentence level is still not satisfactory. One of the main reasons is that metrics underscore acceptable candidate translations due to their inability to tackle lexical and syntactic variation between possible translation options. Acceptable differences between candidate and reference translations are frequently due to optional translation shifts. It is common practice in HT to paraphrase what could be viewed as close version of the source text in order to adapt it to target language use. When a reference translation contains such changes, using it as the only point of comparison is less informative, as the differences are not indicative of MT errors. To alleviate this problem, we design a paraphrase generation system based on a set of rules that model prototypical optional shifts that may have been applied by human translators. Applying the rules to the available human reference, the system generates additional references in a principled and controlled way. We show how using linguistic rules for the generation of additional references neutralizes the negative effect of optional translation shifts on n-gram-based MT evaluation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Machine Translation Evaluation; Paraphrase Generation; Translation shifts","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Linguistics; Quality control; Text processing; Automatic evaluation; Automatic machines; Generation systems; Linguistic rules; Machine translation evaluations; Paraphrase Generation; State of the art; Syntactic variations; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942626904

It is an important factor of quality and efficiency of machine translation systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel reordering model based on an innovative structure, named, phrasal dependency tree. The phrasal dependency tree is a modern syntactic structure which is based on dependency relationships between contiguous non-syntactic phrases. The proposed model integrates syntactical and statistical information in the context of log-linear model aimed at dealing with the reordering problems. It benefits from phrase dependencies, translation directions (orientations) and translation discontinuity between translated phrases. In comparison with well-known and popular reordering models such as distortion, lexicalised and hierarchical models, the experimental study demonstrates the superiority of our model in terms of translation quality. Performance is evaluated for Persian → English and English → German translation tasks using Tehran parallel corpus and WMT07 benchmarks, respectively. The results report 1.54/1.7 and 1.98/3.01 point improvements over the baseline in terms of BLEU/TER metrics on Persian → English and German → English translation tasks, respectively.

However, these services still generate inaccurate results when translating technical terminologies. Therefore, we propose a new method that collects reliable pairs of English-Korean technical terms and translates the given English terminology to Korean. To collect the pairs, we utilize textual big data, such as Korean academic papers, and develop a new statistical model to determine appropriate characteristics. Our method is evaluated in terms of the reliability of English-Korean pairs and the precision of translation. We thus confirm that our method can produce highly reliable data and can positively influence the translation quality of technical terminologies.

This is done by segmenting both S and T into overlapping sub-segments of variable length and translating them into the TL and the SL, respectively, using the available bilingual sources of information on the fly. A collection of features is then obtained from the resulting sub-segment translations, which is used by a binary classifier to determine which target words in T need to be post-edited. Experiments are conducted based on the data sets published for the word-level MTQE task in the 2014 edition of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2014). The sources of bilingual information used are: machine translation (Apertium and Google Translate) and the bilingual concordancer Reverso Context.

Both the training dataset used in the learning of our proposed classifier and our feature extraction method affect the hybridization quality. To create one such training dataset, a previous approach used auto-evaluation metrics to determine from a set of component machine translation (MT) systems which gave the more accurate translation (by a comparative method). Once this had been determined, the most accurate translation was then labelled in such a way so as to indicate the MT system from which it came. In this previous approach, when the metric evaluation scores were low, there existed a high level of uncertainty as to which of the component MT systems was actually producing the better translation. To relax such uncertainty or error in classification, we propose an alternative approach to such labeling; that is, a cut-off method. In our experiments, using the aforementioned cut-off method in our proposed classifier, we managed to achieve a translation accuracy of 81.5% - a 5.0% improvement over existing methods. © 2015 ETRI.","Automatic labeling; Hybrid machine translation; Machine translation; Rule-based machine translation; Statistical machine translation.","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Feature extraction; Linguistics; Automatic labeling; Hybrid machine translation; Machine translations; Rule-based machine translations; Statistical machine translation; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930977750

Since writing styles are changing due to impact of languages on each other, higher version of morphological analyzers are desired for various NLP systems such as Machine Translation, Knowledge Extraction, Information Retrieval, etc. Often word level morphological analyzers adhere to language grammars and knowledge set pertaining to GNP and dictionary. Some algorithms use phrasal dictionaries also. But, impact of languages on each other leads to changes in GNP, grammatical and phrasal usage of words. General morph algorithms cannot deal with impact of such usage of words or phrases. Therefore new generation of morph analyzers are desired to handle cross lingual impact. In this paper, methodology for English language morphological analyzer is proposed for interpretation of phrases and group of words to derive knowledge in Hindi for tourism domain. The methodology, although general, is oriented towards Machine Translation. Proposed methodology is based on creation of knowledge base for morph analyzers using formulations of FST and RTN. Using this methodology, ten categories of phrasal structures in sentences have been identified which when used in MA of RBMT would improve the functional efficiency of MT in producing correct translation. © 2015 IEEE.","bilingual corpus; Finite State Transducers (FST); Knowledge Base; Morphological Analyzer (MA); NLP processes; noise; Recursive Transition Networks (RTN); Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT)","Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Bilingual corpora; Finite state transducers; Knowledge base; Morphological analyzer; noise; Recursive transition networks; Rule-based machine translations; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930385958

Two commonly used approaches to this problem are statistical and example-based methods. In statistical methods, ambiguity resolution is mostly carried out by making use of some statistics extracted from previously translated documents or dual corpora of source and target languages. Example-based methods follow a similar approach as they also make use of bilingual corpora. However, they perform the task of matching at run-time (i.e. online matching). In this paper, by looking at the WSD problem from a different viewpoint, we propose a system, which consists of two main parts. The first part includes a data mining algorithm, which runs offline and extracts some useful knowledge about the co-occurrences of the words. In this algorithm, each sentence is imagined as a transaction in Market Basket Data Analysis problem, and the words included in a sentence play the role of purchased items. The second part of the system is an expert system whose knowledge base consists of the set of association rules generated by the first part.

Typically, these weights are estimated by optimising a given translation quality criterion, taking only into account a certain set of development data (e.g., the adaptation data). In this article, we show that the Bayesian framework provides appropriate estimates of such weights in conditions where adaptation data is scarce. The theoretical framework is presented, alongside with a thorough experimentation and comparison with other weight estimation methods. We provide a comparison of different sampling strategies, including an effective heuristic strategy and a theoretically sound Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm. Experimental results show that Bayesian predictive adaptation (BPA) outperforms the re-estimation from scratch in conditions where adaptation data is scarce. Further analysis reveals that the improvements obtained are due to the greater stability of the estimation procedure. In addition, the proposed BPA framework has a much lower computational cost than raw re-estimation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: We applied a cognitive work analysis framework to investigate the translation information workflow processes of two large health departments in Washington State. Researchers conducted interviews, performed a task analysis, and validated results with PH professionals to model translation workflow and identify functional requirements for a translation system for PH. Results: The study resulted in a detailed description of work related to translation of PH materials, an information workflow diagram, and a description of attitudes towards MT technology. We identified a number of themes that hold design implications for incorporating MT in PH translation practice. A PH translation tool prototype was designed based on these findings. Discussion: This study underscores the importance of understanding the work context and information workflow for which systems will be designed. Based on themes and translation information workflow processes, we identified key design guidelines for incorporating MT into PH translation work. Primary amongst these is that MT should be followed by human review for translations to be of high quality and for the technology to be adopted into practice. Conclusion: The time and costs of creating multilingual health promotion materials are barriers to translation. PH personnel were interested in MT's potential to improve access to low-cost translated PH materials, but expressed concerns about ensuring quality.

The problems envisaged can be of various types, such as, the absence of proper postpositions, inappropriate word order, incorrect semantics. Different existing English to Hindi machine translation systems show their vulnerability, irrespective of the underlying technique. A potential solution to this problem lies in understanding the semantics of the noun compounds. The present paper proposes a scheme based on semantic relations to address this issue. The scheme works in three steps: identification of the noun compounds in a given text, determination of the semantic relationship(s) between them, and finally, selecting the right translation pattern. The scheme provides translation patterns for different semantic relations for 2-word noun compounds first. These patterns are used recursively to find the semantic relations and the translation patterns for 3-word and 4-word noun compounds. Frequency and probability based adjacency and dependency models are used for bracketing (grouping) the constituent words of 3-word and 4-word noun compounds into 2-word noun compounds. The semantic relations and the translation patterns generated for 2-word, 3-word and 4-word noun compounds are evaluated. The proposed scheme is compared with some well-known English to Hindi translators, viz. AnglaMT, Anuvadaksh, Bing, Google, and also with the Moses baseline system. The results obtained, show significant improvement over the Moses baseline system. Also, it performs better than the other online MT systems in terms of recall and precision. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bracketing; Machine translation; Noun compounds; Semantic relation; Translation pattern","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Online systems; Bracketing; Machine translations; Noun compounds; Semantic relations; Translation patterns; Semantics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923668978

It may thus require good pre-processing as it presents significant challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically for Machine Translation (MT). This paper aims to examine how Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) can be improved using rule-based pre-processing and language analysis. We describe a hybrid translation approach coupling an Arabic-French statistical machine translation system using the Moses decoder with additional morphological rules that reduce the morphology of the source language (Arabic) to a level that makes it closer to that of the target language (French). Moreover, we introduce additional swapping rules for a structural matching between the source language and the target language. Two structural changes involving the positions of the pronouns and verbs in both the source and target languages have been attempted. The results show an improvement in the quality of translation and a gain in terms of BLEU score after introducing a pre-processing scheme for Arabic and applying these rules based on morphological variations and verb re-ordering (VS into SV constructions) in the source language (Arabic) according to their positions in the target language (French). Furthermore, a learning curve shows the improvement in terms on BLEU score under scarce- and large-resources conditions. The proposed approach is completed without increasing the amount of training data or radically changing the algorithms that can affect the translation or training engines. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Arabic morphology; ArabicFrench Statistical Machine Translation; BLEU; Linguistic analysis; Machine translation; Moses","Computational linguistics; Morphology; Natural language processing systems; BLEU; Linguistic analysis; Machine translations; Moses; Statistical machine translation; Computer aided language translation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923654496

Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a machine translation paradigm where translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora. It is the most widely used machine translation paradigm for the tradeoff between efficiency and implementation feasibility and due to its partial language independency.

In hierarchical phrase based approach, a rule table is used to reduce the input Tamil sentence into the output English sentence.

Due to the errors in the hypothesis alignment and varying word order between the source and target sentences and also the lack of sufficient resources such as parallel corpora, decoding may result in ungrammatical or non-fluent outputs. This paper proposes a re-ranking system based on swarm algorithms, which makes the use of sophisticated non-syntactical features to re-rank the n-best translation candidates. We introduce plenty of easy-computed non-syntactical features to deal with SMT system errors plus the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm to adjust the weights of features. We have evaluated the proposed approach on 2 translation tasks in different language pairs (Persian → English and German → English) and genres (news and novel books). In comparison with PSO-, GA-, Perceptron- and averaged Perceptron-style re-ranking systems, the experimental study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed system in terms of translation quality on both translation tasks. In addition, the impacts of the proposed features on the translation quality have been analyzed, and the most positive ones have been recognized. At the end, the impact of the n-best list size on the proposed system is investigated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This overhead comes from translation look aside buffer (TLB) misses where the hardware performs a 2D page walk (up to 24 memory references on x86-64) rather than a native TLB miss (up to only 4 memory references). The first dimension translates guest virtual addresses to guest physical addresses, while the second translates guest physical addresses to host physical addresses. This paper proposes new hardware using direct segments with three new virtualized modes of operation that significantly speed-up virtualized address translation. Further, this paper proposes two novel techniques to address important limitations of original direct segments. First, self-ballooning reduces fragmentation in physical memory, and addresses the architectural input/output (I/O) gap in x86-64. Second, an escape filter provides alternate translations for exceptional pages within a direct segment (e.g., Physical pages with permanent hard faults). We emulate the proposed hardware and prototype the software in Linux with KVM on x86-64. One mode - VMM Direct - reduces address translation overhead to near-native without guest application or OS changes (2% slower than native on average), while a more aggressive mode - Dual Direct - on big-memory workloads performs better-than-native with near-zero translation overhead. © 2014 IEEE.","translation lookaside buffer; virtual machines; virtual memory; virtualization","Buffer storage; Computer operating systems; Distributed computer systems; Software prototyping; Virtual addresses; Virtual machine; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Address translation; Memory references; Memory virtualization; Modes of operation; Novel techniques; Translation look aside buffers; Translation lookaside buffer; Virtual memory; Physical addresses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937691489

FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e., n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with five parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the 2 million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to 3.22 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to 0.41 BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only 15% of it, and can reach within 0.5 BLEU points to the full training set result by using only 2.7% of the full training data. FDA5 peaks at around 8M words or 15% of the full training set. In an active learning setting, FDA5 minimizes the human effort by identifying the most informative sentences for translation and FDA gains up to 0.45 BLEU points using 3/5 of the available training data compared to using all of it and 1.12 BLEU points compared to random training set. In translation tasks involving English and Turkish, a morphologically rich language, FDA5 can gain up to 11.52 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can achieve the same BLEU score using as little as 4% of the data compared to random instance selection, and can exceed the full dataset result by 0.78 BLEU points.

This task represents a low-level parsing of the sequence into linguistically-motivated phrases. CRF represents the established method for implementing such a data-driven parser, while template-matching is a simpler method that is faster to train and operate. The two aforementioned techniques are compared here to determine the most suitable approach for extracting an accurate model. The specific application studied is related to a machine translation (MT) methodology (namely PRESEMT), though the comparison performed holds for other applications as well, for which only sparse training data are available. PRESEMT uses small parallel corpora to learn structural transformations from a source language (SL) to a target language (TL) and thus translate input text. This results in the availability of only sparse training data from which to train the parser. Experimental results indicate that for a limited-size training set, as is the case for the PRESEMT methodology, template-matching generates a superior phrasing model that in turn generates higher quality translations. This is confirmed by studying more than one source/target language pairs, for multiple independent testsets. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and their associated diseases. Results: By exploiting morpho-syntactic information of the text, BeFree is able to identify gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations with state-of-the-art performance. The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation, in order to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications. Conclusions: BeFree is a novel text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources (2%), raising several issues on data prioritization and curation. We propose that joint analysis of text mined data with data curated by experts appears as a suitable approach to both assess data quality and highlight novel and interesting information. © 2015 Bravo et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Big data; Biocuration; Corpus development; Disease; Information extraction; Machine learning; Text mining; Translational bioinformatics","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Bioinformatics; Data integration; Data reduction; Diseases; Genes; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quality control; Biocuration; Corpus development; Gene-disease associations; Large-scale data analysis; Relationships between entities; Scientific publications; State-of-the-art performance; Text mining; Data mining; classification; data mining; depression; diseases; factual database; genetics; human; information retrieval; knowledge base; Medline; procedures; publication; translational research; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Depression; Disease; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Knowledge Bases; MEDLINE; Publications; Translational Medical Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931264092

To express the translation quality, the previous lexical and phrasal probabilities are calculated only according to the co-occurrence statistics in the bilingual corpus and may be not reliable due to the data sparseness problem. To address this issue, we propose measuring the quality of the translation rules and their composition in the semantic vector embedding space (VES). We present a recursive neural network (RNN)-based translation framework, which includes two submodels. One is the bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoder, which is proposed to convert the lexical translation rules into compact real-valued vectors in the semantic VES. The other is a type-dependent recursive neural network, which is proposed to perform the decoding process by minimizing the semantic gap (meaning distance) between the source language string and its translation candidates at each state in a bottom-up structure. The RNN-based translation model is trained using a max-margin objective function that maximizes the margin between the reference translation and the n-best translations in forced decoding. In the experiments, we first show that the proposed vector representations for the translation rules are very reliable for application in translation modeling. We further show that the proposed type-dependent, RNN-based model can significantly improve the translation quality in the large-scale, end-to-end Chinese-to-English translation evaluation. © 2015 ACM","Max-margin training; Recursive neural network; Semantic meaning distance; Statistical machine translation; Vector embedding space","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Decoding; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Vectors; Co-occurrence statistics; Data sparseness problem; Machine translations; Objective functions; Recursive neural networks; Statistical machine translation; Translation quality; Vector representations; Vector spaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057526627

This trend in turn raises an issue in the industry, namely, a lack of post-editors. To meet the growing demand for PE, new populations—such as college language learners—should be assessed as potential post-editor candidates. This paper investigates this possibility through an experiment focusing on college language learners’ PE qualifications and resultant performance. Data collected on perceived ease of task, editing quantity, and quality of final product were correlated with the students’ course grades. The investigation found that over 74 % of students felt PE to be an easier task than HT, whereas 26 % did not. Those students who did not find PE easier were determined to be unqualified post-editors. Students who received poor grades in a traditional translation course were also confirmed to be unqualified, though A-students were not always qualified post-editors. The variable performance among A-students may be understood in terms of different approaches to PE, characterized as utilizing either analytic or integrated processing. An analysis using this framework tentatively concludes that A-students who apply an analytic approach, more typical of novice translators, may perform better as post-editors than those who take an integrated approach. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Machine translation; Post-editing; Post-editor; Student translator; Translation training","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Analytic approach; College students; Integrated approach; Machine translations; Post editors; Post-editing; Translation trainings; Variable performance; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925504609

Aiming at coping with this drawback, lots of efforts have been made to post-edit those errors either manually or automatically. Manual post-editing is more accurate but can be prohibitive when too many changes have to be made. Automatic post-editing demands less effort but can also be less effective and give rise to new errors. A way to avoid unnecessary automatic post-editing and new errors is by previously selecting only the machine-translated segments that really need to be post-edited. Thus, this paper describes the experiments carried out to automatically identify MT errors generated by a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system. Despite the fact that our experiments have been carried out using a statistical MT engine, we believe the approach can also be applied to other types of MT systems. The experiments investigated the well-known machine-learning algorithms Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. Using the decision tree algorithm it was possible to identify wrong segments with around 77 % precision and recall when a small training corpus of only 2,147 error instances was used. Our experiments were performed on English-to-Brazilian Portuguese MT, and although some of the features are language-dependent, the proposed approach is language-independent and can be easily generalized to other language pairs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Automatic error identification; Automatic post-edition; Machine learning; Machine translation","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Decision trees; Errors; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Automatic machines; Automatic post-edition; Decision-tree algorithm; Error identification; Language independents; Machine translations; Precision and recall; State of the art; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912551836

We introduce algorithms to integrate the two proposed models into two kinds of state-of-the-art phrase-based decoders. Our experimental results on Chinese/Spanish/Vietnamese-to-English show that both models are able to significantly improve translation quality in terms of BLEU and METEOR over a competitive baseline.

To bridge different languages, interactive translation that involves non-experts to iterate the inputs of machine translation (MT) for better translations can be useful. However, there is a design issue on how to provide feedback of estimated translation quality to support workers' iterative editing actions. In a lab study, we evaluated the effects of different types of interface feedback (back translation, numeric score of estimated translation quality, and anthropomorphic social messages). The results confirmed the utility of using numeric score and social messages as feedback, and shed light on the design of MT interface and crosslingual communication support.","Computers are social actors; Crosslingual communication; Emotional agents; Interactive translation system; Machine translation","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Computers are social actors; Cross-lingual communication; Emotional agents; Machine translations; Translation systems; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954212663

Although some word reordering methods do not employ source-language syntactic structures, such structures are inherently useful for word reordering. However, high-quality syntactic parsers are not available for many languages. We propose a preordering method using a target-language syntactic parser to process source-language syntactic structures without a source-language syntactic parser. To train our preordering model based on ITG, we produced syntactic constituent structures for source-language training sentences by (1) parsing target-language training sentences, (2) projecting constituent structures of the target-language sentences to the corresponding source-language sentences, (3) selecting parallel sentences with highly synchronized parallel structures, (4) producing probabilistic models for parsing using the projected partial structures and the Pitman-Yor process, and (5) parsing to produce full binary syntactic structures maximally synchronized with the corresponding target-language syntactic structures, using the constraints of the projected partial structures and the probabilistic models. Our ITG-based preordering model is trained using the produced binary syntactic structures and word alignments. The proposed method facilitates the learning of ITG by producing highly synchronized parallel syntactic structures based on crosslanguage syntactic projection and sentence selection. The preordering model jointly parses input sentences and identifies their reordered structures. Experiments with Japanese-English and Chinese-English patent translation indicate that our method outperforms existing methods, including string-to-tree syntax-based SMT, a preordering method that does not require a parser, and a preordering method that uses a sourcelanguage dependency parser.","Constituent structure; Inversion transduction grammar; Preordering; Syntactic projection","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Context free grammars; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Synchronization; Translation (languages); Inversion transduction grammars; Parallel structures; Partial structures; Pre orderings; Probabilistic models; Statistical machine translation; Syntactic projection; Syntactic structure; Syntactics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009355261

Annotators have to decide whether a sentence is better than another or not, using, for example, adequacy and fluency criteria or, as recently proposed, editing the translation output so that it has the same meaning as a reference translation, and it is understandable. Therefore, the important fields of linguistics of meaning (semantics) and grammar (syntax) are indirectly considered. In this study, we propose to go one step further towards a linguistic human evaluation. The idea is to introduce linguistics implicitly by formulating precise guidelines. These guidelines strictly mark the difference between the subfields of linguistics such as: morphology, syntax, semantics, and orthography. We show our guidelines have a high inter-annotation agreement and wide-error coverage. Additionally, we examine how the linguistic human evaluation data correlate with: among different types of machine translation systems (rule and statistical-based); and with adequacy and fluency. © The Author 2013.

MT is used as a black box to align source and target sub-segments on the fly in the translation units (TUs) suggested to the user. Source-language (SL) and target-language (TL) segments in the matching TUs are segmented into overlapping sub-segments of variable length and machine-translated into the TL and the SL, respectively. The bilingual subsegments obtained and the matching between the SL segment in the TU and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited. In this approach, MT results are never presented to the translator. Two approaches are presented in this work: one using a word-keeping recommendation system which can be trained on the TM used with the CAT system, and a more basic approach which does not require any training. Experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of texts in several language pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different MT systems. We compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for word-keeping recommendation, and show that the MT-based approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios. In particular, our results confirm that the MT-based approaches are better than the alignment-based approach when using models trained on out-of-domain TMs. Additional experiments were also performed to check how dependent the MT-based recommender is on the language pair and MT system used for training. These experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various MT systems, but a low level of reusability across language pairs. ©2015 AI Access Foundation.
