The approach is based on a rule-based MT (RBMT) system which creates template translations. Based on the rule-based generation parse tree and target-to-target alignments, we identify the set of "interesting" translation candidates from one or more translation engines which could be substituted into our translation templates. The substitution process is either controlled by the output from a binary classifier trained on feature vectors from the different MT engines, or it is depending on weights for the decision factors, which have been tuned using MERT. We are able to observe improvements in terms of BLEU scores over a baseline version of the hybrid system.},

abstract = {Interactive machine translation (IMT) [1] is an alternative approach to machine translation, integrating human expertise into the automatic translation process. In this framework, a human iteratively interacts with a system until the output desired by the human is completely generated. Traditionally, interaction has been performed using a keyboard and a mouse. However, the use of touchscreens has been popularised recently. Many touchscreen devices already exist in the market, namely mobile phones, laptops and tablet computers like the iPad. In this work, we propose a new interaction modality to take advantage of such devices, for which online handwritten text seems a very natural way of input. Multimodality is formulated as an extension to the traditional IMT protocol where the user can amend errors by writing text with an electronic pen or a stylus on a touchscreen. Different approaches to modality fusion have been studied. In addition, these approaches have been assessed on the Xerox task. Finally, a thorough study of the errors committed by the online handwritten system will show future work directions.},

abstract = {Machine transliteration is an important problem in an increasingly multilingual world, as it plays a critical role in many downstream applications, such as machine translation or crosslingual information retrieval systems. In this article, we propose compositional machine transliteration systems, where multiple transliteration components may be composed either to improve existing transliteration quality, or to enable transliteration functionality between languages even when no direct parallel names corpora exist between them. Specifically, we propose two distinct forms of composition: serial and parallel. Serial compositional system chains individual transliteration components, say, X → Y and Y → Z systems, to provide transliteration functionality, X → Z. In parallel composition evidence from multiple transliteration paths between X → Z are aggregated for improving the quality of a direct system. We demonstrate the functionality and performance benefits of the compositional methodology using a state-of-the-art machine transliteration framework in English and a set of Indian languages, namely, Hindi, Marathi, and Kannada. Finally, we underscore the utility and practicality of our compositional approach by showing that a CLIR system integrated with compositional transliteration systems performs consistently on par with, and sometimes better than, that integrated with a direct transliteration system.},

abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models based on Transformer achieve promising progress in both translation quality and training speed. Such a strong framework adopts parallel structures that greatly improve the decoding speed without losing quality. However, due to the self-attention network in decoder that cannot maintain the parallelization under the auto-regressive scheme, the Transformer did not enjoy the same speed performance as training when inference. In this work, with simplicity and feasibility in mind, we introduce a gated cumulative attention network to replace the self-attention part in Transformer decoder to maintain the parallelization property in the inference phase. The gated cumulative attention network includes two sub-layers, a gated linearly cumulative layer that creates the relationship between already predicted tokens and current representation, and a feature fusion layer that enhances the representation with a feature fusion operation. The proposed method was evaluated on WMT17 datasets with 12 language pair groups. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and also demonstrated that the proposed gated cumulative attention network has adequate ability as an alternative to the self-attention part in the Transformer decoder.},

abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the current trend approach in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve the problem of auto- matically inferring the content of target language given the source language. The ability of NMT is to learn deep knowledge inside lan- guages by deep learning approaches. However, prior works show that NMT has its own drawbacks in NLP and in some research problems of Software Engineering (SE). In this work, we provide a hypothesis that SE corpus has inherent characteristics that NMT will confront challenges compared to the state-of-the-art translation engine based on Statistical Machine Translation. We introduce a problem which is significant in SE and has characteristics that challenges the abil- ity of NMT to learn correct sequences, called Prefix Mapping. We implement and optimize the original SMT and NMT to mitigate those challenges. By the evaluation, we show that SMT outperforms NMT for this research problem, which provides potential directions to optimize the current NMT engines for specific classes of parallel corpus. By achieving the accuracy from 65% to 90% for code tokens generation of 1000 Github code corpus, we show the potential of using MT for code completion at token level.},

We investigate MT and MRD to Arabic-English CLIR. The translation ambiguity associated with these resources is the key problem. We present three methods of query translation using a bilingual dictionary for Arabic-English CLIR. First, we present the Every-Match (EM) method. This method yields ambiguous translations since many extraneous terms are added to the original query. To disambiguate the query translation, we present the First-Match (FM) method that considers the first match in the dictionary as the candidate term. Finally, we present the Two-Phase (TP) method. We show that good retrieval effectiveness can be achieved without complex resources using the Two-Phase method for Arabic-English CLIR. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the MT-based method using short, medium, and long queries from TREC. The effects of the query length on the quality of the MT-based CLIR are investigated.},

Despite using only features from e-rater and without comparing to translations, MTeRater achieves a sentence-level correlation with human rankings equivalent to BLEU. Since MTeRater only assesses fluency, we build a meta-metric, MTeRater-Plus, that incorporates adequacy by combining MTeRater with other MT evaluation metrics and heuristics. This meta-metric has a higher correlation with human rankings than either MTeRater or individual MT metrics alone.

However, tagged corpora contain errors, which impedes the progress of research. Therefore, the correction of errors in corpora is an important research issue. In this study we investigate the correction of such errors, which we call corpus correction. Using machine-learning methods, we applied corpus correction to a verb modality corpus for machine translation. We used the maximum-entropy and decision-list methods as machine-learning methods. We compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments, and determined which is most effective by using a statistical test. We obtained several noteworthy findings: (1) Precision was almost the same for both detection and correction, so it is more convenient to do both correction and detection, rather than detection only. (2) In general, the maximum-entropy method worked better than the decision-list method; but the two methods had almost the same precision for the top 50 pieces of extracted data when closed data was used. (3) In terms of precision, the use of closed data was better than the use of open data; however, in terms of the total number of extracted errors, the use of open data was better than the use of closed data. Based on our analysis of these results, we developed a good method for corpus correction. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by carrying out experiments on machine translation. As corpus-based machine translation continues to be developed, the corpus correction we discuss in this article should prove to be increasingly significant.},

The nodes in the generation tree and target-side SCFG tree are aligned and form the basis for computing structural similarity. Structural similarity computation aligns subtrees and based on this alignment, subtrees are substituted to create more accurate translations. Two different techniques have been implemented to compute structural similarity: leaves and tree-edit distance. I report on the translation quality of a machine translation (MT) system where both techniques are implemented. The approach shows significant improvement over the baseline for MT systems with limited training data and structural improvement for MT systems trained on Europarl.},

In this framework, it is assumed that a large candidate list including the correct transliteration is given. Therefore, the transliteration problem is simplified into the selection problem of the correct entry from the large list. We have developed an efficient algorithm of this framework and applied it to English-Japanese transliteration of person names. Experimental results show that our algorithm is practical even if the size of the candidate list is over a million.},

Human annotations were used to refine the Translation Error Rate (TER) annotations. The analyses were performed on approximately 100 translations into each language from four translation systems. Results include high frequencies of pronoun errors and errors involving the copula in translations to English. High frequencies of errors in subject/person inflection and closed-word classes characterized translations to Iraqi Arabic. There were similar frequencies of word order errors in both translation directions and low frequencies of polarity errors. The problems associated with many errors can be predicted from structural differences between the two languages. Also problematic is the need to insert lexemes not present in the source or vice versa. Some problems associated with deictic elements like pronouns will require knowledge of the discourse context to resolve.},

TransRepair combines mutation with metamorphic testing to detect inconsistency bugs (without access to human oracles). It then adopts probability-reference or cross-reference to post-process the translations, in a grey-box or black-box manner, to repair the inconsistencies. Our evaluation on two state-of-the-art translators, Google Translate and Transformer, indicates that TransRepair has a high precision (99%) on generating input pairs with consistent translations. With these tests, using automatic consistency metrics and manual assessment, we find that Google Translate and Transformer have approximately 36% and 40% inconsistency bugs. Black-box repair fixes 28% and 19% bugs on average for Google Translate and Transformer. Grey-box repair fixes 30% bugs on average for Transformer. Manual inspection indicates that the translations repaired by our approach improve consistency in 87% of cases (degrading it in 2%), and that our repairs have better translation acceptability in 27% of the cases (worse in 8%).},

So, using statistical approach for such language will not be a good choice, because this approach requires large parallel corpora to well train probabilistic models, and to ensure a translation of good quality. Since we dispose of an Amazigh IBMT based deconverter, we thought, firstly, to use it in building an Amazigh-English parallel corpus. This latter have been exploited to train the necessary models in SBMT.},

abstract = {Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a necessary step in Chinese-English statistical machine translation (SMT) and its performance has an impact on the results of SMT. However, there are many choices involved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. The choices made will create a new CWS scheme, but whether it will produce a superior or inferior translation has remained unknown to date. This article examines the relationship between CWS and SMT. The effects of CWS on SMT were investigated using different specifications and CWS methods. Four specifications were selected for investigation: Beijing University (PKU), Hong Kong City University (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR), and Academia SINICA (AS). We created 16 CWS schemes under different settings to examine the relationship between CWS and SMT. Our experimental results showed that the MSR's specifications produced the lowest quality translations. In examining the effects of CWS methods, we tested dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the quality of the resulting translations. We also found the correlation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. We analyzed CWS errors and their effect on SMT by evaluating systems trained with and without these errors. This article also proposes two methods for combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated. We found these approaches were very effective in improving the quality of translations.},

abstract = {In a country like India where 22 languages are constitutionally accepted presents a language barrier among people. For better communication, a number of Machine Translation systems between a variety of language pairs have been developed, many of these systems are domain specific. These researches have though helped in reducing the language barrier to some extent, a lot more research needs to be done to develop MT systems in a number of unexplored and emerging domains. This paper first takes an overview of the status of MT systems in India across domains and language pairs and then discusses the requirement of an MT system for an unexplored domain i.e. question paper translation. We performed an experimental analysis of translation of a set of 100 questions (taken from various sources) from English to Hindi using three popular MT systems (Google translator, Bing and SDL translator). Our test results using BLEU metric show that translation accuracy of these systems is poor. The results clearly emphasize the need of suitable MT system for domain specific translations such as question paper translation.},

abstract = {Elements of the history, state of the art, and probable future of Machine Translation (MT) are discussed. The treatment is largely tutorial, based on the assumption that this audience is, for the most part, ignorant of matters pertaining to translation in general, and MT in particular. The paper covers some of the major MT R&amp;D groups, the general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles they play(ed) in the development of the field. The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.},

abstract = {Machine translation software has become heavily integrated into our daily lives due to the recent improvement in the performance of deep neural networks. However, machine translation software has been shown to regularly return erroneous translations, which can lead to harmful consequences such as economic loss and political conflicts. Additionally, due to the complexity of the underlying neural models, testing machine translation systems presents new challenges. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Chinese (En-Zh). The results show that PatInv can accurately find 308 erroneous translations in Google Translate and 223 erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator, most of which cannot be found by the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = { In the era of mobile computing, developers often need to migrate code written for one platform in a programming language to another language for a different platform, e.g., from Java for Android to C# for Windows Phone. The migration process is often performed manually or semi-automatically, in which developers are required to manually define translation rules and API mappings. This paper presents semSMT, an automatic tool to migrate code written in Java to C#. semSMT utilizes statistical machine translation to automatically infer translation rules from existing migrated code, thus, requires no manual defining of rules. The video demonstration on semSMT can be found on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRSnl5-7vNo. },

abstract = {In recent years, machine translation software has increasingly been integrated into our daily lives. People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored.To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of "similar" source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic.},

abstract = {We present translation results on the shared task "Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine Translation" generated by a chart parsing decoder operating on phrase tables augmented and generalized with target language syntactic categories. We use a target language parser to generate parse trees for each sentence on the target side of the bilingual training corpus, matching them with phrase table lattices built for the corresponding source sentence. Considering phrases that correspond to syntactic categories in the parse trees we develop techniques to augment (declare a syntactically motivated category for a phrase pair) and generalize (form mixed terminal and nonterminal phrases) the phrase table into a synchronous bilingual grammar. We present results on the French-to-English task for this workshop, representing significant improvements over the workshop's baseline system. Our translation system is available open-source under the GNU General Public License.},
