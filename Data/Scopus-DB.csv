However, recently there have been also attempts to add linguistic annotation into neural translation models, and steps towards more linguistically motivated models. This paper presents an extension of NMT model to incorporate additional Part-of-Speech (POS) tags into the attention mechanism effectively to yield further improvements. The context vector produced by source annotations and target hidden state is used for target POS tagging. Then, we improve word prediction by simultaneously utilizing the context vector from attention layer and the predicted target POS tags.

Such continuous representations of translation units lead to smoother translation results, but do not always guarantee better results due to wrong word translations, compared to statistical machine translation systems. Moreover, for low-resource language pairs, such as Russian-Vietnamese, the errors of word translations in neural machine translation systems are more aggravated. In order to solve the problem, we try different ways of con-catenating source word embeddings with embeddings of their corresponding word transla-tions, when building a Transformer-based translation system for the Russian-Vietnamese language pair. As a result, we create two novel Transformer models: Transformer with Long Encoder and Transformer with Short Encoder. In the Transformer with Long Encoder source word embedding and translation embedding of single size are concatenated to form a vector of double size. The Long Encoder reduces the size of the concatenated embedding to single size with a linear layer, and then adds it with positional embedding of the source word to create a final embedding. The Short Encoder resembles the Long Encoder except for the linear layer. Instead, the Short Encoder creates word embedding and translation embedding of half-size, and then concatenates them to form a concatenated embedding of single size. The experimental results show that the proposed models provide better translation quality compared to the baseline Transformer model. © 2020 Global Research Online.

From this point, we firstly propose two novel translation memory methods to characterize similarity between sentences on syntactic and template dimensions separately. Based on that, we propose a similarity-aware neural machine translation (similarity-NMT) which consists of two independent modules: (1) Identification Module, which can identify high-potential sentences of testing set according to multi-dimensional similarity information; (2) Translation Module, which can integrate multi-dimensional similarity information of parallel training sentence pairs into an attention-based NMT model by leveraging posterior regularization.

However, machine translation software has been shown to regularly return erroneous translations, which can lead to harmful consequences such as economic loss and political conflicts. Additionally, due to the complexity of the underlying neural models, testing machine translation systems presents new challenges. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Chinese (En-Zh). The results show that PatInv can accurately find 308 erroneous translations in Google Translate and 223 erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator, most of which cannot be found by the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020 ACM.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:16","2021-02-07 01:17:16","","863-875","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine translation; Pathological Invariance; Testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2020 - Proceedings of the 28th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MNMT is more promising and interesting than its statistical machine translation counterpart, because end-to-end modeling and distributed representations open new avenues for research on machine translation. Many approaches have been proposed to exploit multilingual parallel corpora for improving translation quality. However, the lack of a comprehensive survey makes it difficult to determine which approaches are promising and, hence, deserve further exploration. In this article, we present an in-depth survey of existing literature on MNMT. We first categorize various approaches based on their central use-case and then further categorize them based on resource scenarios, underlying modeling principles, core-issues, and challenges. Wherever possible, we address the strengths and weaknesses of several techniques by comparing them with each other. We also discuss the future directions for MNMT.

We use these to augment machine translation systems' training data and show that, when tested on noisy data, systems trained using adversarial examples perform almost as well as when translating clean data, while baseline systems' performance drops by 2-3 BLEU points. To measure the robustness and noise invariance of machine translation systems' outputs, we use the average translation edit rate between the translation of the original sentence and its noised variants. Using this measure, we show that systems trained on adversarial examples on average yield 50 % consistency improvements when compared to baselines trained on clean data. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:24","2021-02-07 01:17:24","","","80","","328","","","","Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 86","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Neural machine translation; Noisy data; Robustness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to meet this demand, I propose a framework of a system to classify patent documents in this paper. This system uses machine translation to deal with synonym and Rough Set theory to classify patent documents. First, it extracts decision rules by Rough Set Theory from labeled patent documents translated by machine translation. Then, it classifies unlabeled patent documents by estimating labels based on the weight of the matched rules. In this approach, the satisfactory index (SI), the coverage index (CI) and the Lift value are used as the weight of rules and they are compared with the maximum number, the total number and the Mahalanobis distance. I evaluated this idea by classifying Japanese patent documents using a prototype system based on this idea. In the evaluation, the accuracy was about 0.40 and the accuracy has not reached the practical level. Therefore I will apply this approach to other document classification task and improve it based on the analysis result of them. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

The purpose of the study is to analyze existing machine translation technologies, identify the main errors in the translation of the texts of various subjects, and select the translator which does the highest quality translation of various thematic texts. Two main machine translation technologies have been in focus of the research: A rule-based translation technology (Rule-Based Machine Translation, RBMT) and a statistical translation technology (Statistical Machine Translation, SMT). It has been found out that each technology has both advantages and disadvantages. Among all the studied translation systems, namely Translate.ru (PROMT), Trident Software (Pragma), SYSTRANet, Babylon, Google Translate and Yandex.Perevod, Yandex has proved to be the most successful to complete the translation task regardless of the subject of the translation. Furthermore, it translates various lexical units quite well and confidently copes with grammatical constructions. As it has been found out, Google Translate is inferior to Yandex in the translation of lexical units, especially thematic ones, but has almost the same indicators regarding grammatical correctness. In the third place is the PROMT translator, which translates grammatical constructions well, but has problems with translating thematic vocabulary. The conclusion that can be derived from the research is that we have the most reason to advise Yandex.Perevod to use for translating the texts of different subjects. Despite of the fact that a genuine solution to the problem of machine translation has not yet been found, the development of new scientific theories, modern achievements in the field of Computer Science, Programming, and Linguistics give hope that it will be possible to satisfactory solve this task in the immediate future. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:29","2021-02-07 01:17:29","","3338-3352","","16","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Computer Technologies; Computerized Terminological Base; Machine Translation; Translation Process; Translation Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although emerging literature dealing with low resource languages starts to show promising results, most state-of-the-art models used millions of sentences. Today, the majority of multi-domain adaptation techniques are based on complex and sophisticated architectures that are not adapted for real-world applications. So far, no scalable method is performing better than the simple yet effective mixed-finetuning, i.e finetuning a generic model with a mix of all specialized data and generic data. In this paper, we propose a new training pipeline where knowledge distillation and multiple specialized teachers allow us to efficiently finetune a model without adding new costs at inference time.

To extract the visual features associated with the text, we design a modulation network based on the textual information from the encoder and visual information from the pretrained CNN. However, because multimodal translation data is scarce, using overly complicated models could result in poor performance. For simplicity, we apply a feature-wise multiplicative transformation.

Neural MT (NMT), an end-to-end learning approach to MT, represents the current state-of-the-art in MT research. The recent studies on interactive MT have indicated that NMT can significantly outperform PB-SMT.In this work, first we investigate the possibility of integrating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags into the state-of-the-art NMT model, Transformer. Then, we explore whether integration of supertags into Transformer could indeed reduce human efforts in translation in an interactive-predictive platform. From our investigation we found that our syntax-aware interactive NMT (INMT) framework significantly reduces simulated human efforts in the French-to-English and Hindi- to-English translation tasks, achieving a 2.65 point absolute corresponding to 5.65% relative improvement and a 6.55 point absolute corresponding to 19.1% relative improvement, respectively, in terms of word prediction accuracy (WPA) over the respective baselines. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:39","2021-02-07 01:17:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","interactive neural machine translation; machine translation; neural machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be specific, the generation inconsistency between the training and inference process further causes error accumulation and distribution disparity. Furthermore, NMT models are generally optimized on word-level cross-entropy loss function but evaluated by sentence-level metrics. This evaluation-level mismatch may mislead the promotion of translation performance. To address these two drawbacks, we propose to challenge training to gradually simulate inference. Namely, the decoder is fed with inferred words rather than ground truth words during training with a dynamic probability. To ensure accuracy and integrity, we adopt alignment and tailoring on the inferred words. Therefore, these words can leverage inferred information to help improve the training process. As for the dynamic simulation, we define a novel loss-sensitive probability that can sense the converge of training and finetune itself in turn. Experimental results on IWSLT 2016 German-English and WMT 2019 English-Chinese datasets demonstrate that our methodology can significantly improve translation quality. The approach of alignment and tailoring outperforms previous works.

People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored. To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of similar source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:44","2021-02-07 01:17:44","","961-973","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine translation; Metamorphic testing; Structural invariance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, the neural multimodal translation models have made attractive progress, which combines images into deep learning networks, such as Transformer and RNN. When considering images in translation models, they directly apply gate structure or image attention to introduce image feature to enhance the translation effect. We argue that it may mismatch the text and image features since they are in different semantic space. In this paper, we propose a coordinated representation learning enhanced multimodal machine translation approach with multimodal attention. Our approach accepts the text data and its relevant image data as the input. The image features are fed into the decoder side of the basic Transformer model. Moreover, the Coordinated Representation Learning is utilized to map the different text and image modal features into their semantic representations. The mapped representations are linearly related in a shared semantic space. Finally, the sum of the image and text representations, called Coordinated Visual-Semantic Representation (CVSR), will be sent to a Multimodal Attention Layer (MAL) in our Transformer based translation approach.

A significant number of Artificial Intelligence tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased toward some minority, with reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Apple’s Iphone X failing to differentiate between two distinct Asian people and the now infamous case of Google photos’ mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI.In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it in order to build sentences in constructions like “He/She is an Engineer” (where “Engineer” is replaced by the job position of interest) in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender neutral pronouns in the translated output.We then show that Google Translate exhibits a strong tendency toward male defaults, in particular for fields typically associated to unbalanced gender distribution or stereotypes such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS’ data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, in which we show that Google Translate fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. In summary, we provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, Google Translate yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone.

For resource-scarce NMT that have small-scale training corpus, the effect is amplified. The traditional approach of amplifying the scale of the corpus is not applicable, because the parallel corpus is difficult to obtain in a resource-scarce setting; however, it is easy to obtain and utilize external knowledge, bilingual lexicon, and other resources. Therefore, we propose classification lexicon approach for processing unknown words in the Chinese-Vietnamese NMT task. Specifically, three types of unknown Chinese-Vietnamese words are classified and their corresponding classification lexicon are constructed by word alignment, Wikipedia extraction, and rule-based methods, respectively. After translation, the unknown words are restored by lexicon for post-processing.

However, at present, machine translation research still has problems such as insufficient bilingual data and lack of effective feature representation, which affects the further improvement of key modules of machine translation such as word alignment, sequence adjustment and translation modelling. The effect of machine translation is still unsatisfactory. As a new machine learning method, deep neural network can automatically learn abstract feature representation and establish a complex mapping relationship between input and output signals, which provides a new idea for statistical machine translation research. Firstly, the multi-layer neural network and the undirected probability graph model are combined, and the similarity and context information of vocabulary are effectively utilized to model the word alignment more fully, and the word alignment model named NNWAM is constructed. Secondly, the low dimension will be used. The feature representation is combined with other features into a linearly ordered pre-ordering model to construct the pre-ordering model named NNPR. Finally, the word alignment model and the pre-ordering model are combined in the same deep neural network framework to form DNNAPM, a statistical machine translation model based on deep neural networks. The experimental results show that the statistical machine translation model based on deep neural network has better effect, faster convergence and better reliability than the comparison model algorithm. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:56","2021-02-07 01:17:56","","643-661","","3","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Deep neural network; Machine translation; Model; Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem with such consequent non-linear activations is that they significantly decrease the magnitude of the gradient in a deep neural network, and thus gradually loosen the interaction between source words and their translations. As a result, a source word may be incorrectly translated into a target word out of its translational equivalents. In this article, we propose short-path units (SPUs) to strengthen the association of source and target words by allowing information flow over adjacent layers effectively via linear interpolation. In particular, we enrich three critical NMT components with SPUs: (1) an enriched encoding model with SPU, which interpolates source word embeddings linearly into source annotations; (2) an enriched decoding model with SPU, which enables the source context linearly flow to target-side hidden states; and (3) an enriched output model with SPU, which further allows linear interpolation of target-side hidden states into output states. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English, English-to-German, and low-resource Tibetan-to-Chinese translation tasks demonstrates that the linear interpolation of SPUs significantly improves the overall translation quality by 1.88, 1.43, and 3.75 BLEU, respectively. Moreover, detailed analysis shows that our approaches much strengthen the association of source and target words. From the preceding, we can see that our proposed model is effective both in rich- and low-resource scenarios. © 2020 ACM.","2020","2021-02-07 01:17:58","2021-02-07 01:17:58","","","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","low resource; Neural machine translation; neural networks; short-path units","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having adopted such a classical approach can give us better translation mainly in terms of morphology and syntax. Moreover, it also allows us to automate the translation task to build a training dataset (parallel corpus), which can be exploited whether for hybridization with the statistical approach or even for the newly developed neural-network method. To do that, our work is based on a free open source platform, named Apertium, which provides a whole environment that includes all required tools to develop an RBMT system. Therefore, the translation process starts by given TD input text, where the data are passed through three big parts, which are respectively morphological analysis and disambiguation, lexical and structural transfer, and morphological generation and spelling corrections to get the translated text in MSA. In fact, each of these stages is a challenge. It should be noted that we have made a great effort to create the required resources from scratch starting by the two monolingual morphological dictionaries for TD and MSA, the bilingual lexical dictionary to map TD words to their equivalents in MSA, and finally setting up more than 500 rules for disambiguation and structural transfer. The proposed system is evaluated by three metrics: WER, TER and BLEU score. As a result, we respectively reach 23.28%, 23.85% and 55.22, which are promising scores. © 2020 The Authors.

We study interactions among human translators to help define potential Human-Machine Interface (HCI) and Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) models for human-centered machine translation systems. The role of the machine, in this context, is to be an AI-based agent serving as a real-time partner. The questions we ask are that if we have such an agent, what are the main functions of the agent, how does the agent interact with a human translator in a way where they can work symbiotically as partners, what human deficiencies can be augmented by an AI-based agent and how, and what kind of human behaviors should the AI-based agent mimic. We used a data set collected from an online translation study group composed of certified and highly experienced translators (both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English), and altogether we analyzed several hundred dialogs between these translators related to the translation results. Each dialog always started with an initial comment and would focus on one of many possible categories. The first question we asked was which categories were discussed more frequently than the others, and why. At both the word level and above the word level, three dominating categories were found: source misunderstanding, target expression problem, and confirmation on good translation. In addition, we found that the more than half of the dialogs focused only at the word-level. The second question we asked was whether a discussion (represented by a dialog) was effective or not. What we found was that the most common pattern was the one associated with “simple but effective” dialog, while constructive dialogs were conversely very infrequent. Based on these findings, we derive the HCI/HMT design implications for an AI-based translation agent: provide better capability beyond the word/phrase level to complement human deficiencies; focus on building algorithms to support better source understanding and target expression delivery; provide quick information search and retrieval to support real-time interaction; provide confirmation to a human partner’s good translation with reasons and explanations; provide help regarding source understanding and target language delivery based on the native language of the human partner; act in the role of a “lead translator” who has better domain and linguistic knowledge, superior cognitive capability, and unique analytic perspectives to complement human deficiency; and perform in-depth constructive dialogs with human partners by stimulating thought. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","2020","2021-02-07 01:18:20","2021-02-07 01:18:20","","","70","","12217 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 81 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50334-5_5","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Argument; Artificial intelligence; Dialog; Explanation; Human-centered; Human-human teaming; Human-machine interaction; Human-Machine Teaming; Machine translation; Teaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are several challenges associated with ensuring that humanoid robots are able to speak human languages.

The target language is manually converted to the robot language to ensure that humanoid robots can communicate appropriately using human languages. Two facets ought to be incorporated into such translations: a dictionary for correct pronunciation must be created and another dictionary for expressing emotions must be created. This paper describes an approach that enables the humanoid robot NAO/Pepper to execute human-friendly communication. We manually prepared 32,293 pairs of sentences in Japanese and robot language as training data. Further, we created dictionaries to associate the correct pronunciations and emotional expressions with each pair of sentences using the morphemic analyzer MeCab. Finally, we developed a machine translation system by incorporating these dictionaries to translate Japanese to robot language. The performance of the machine translation system was verified using test sentences, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed machine translation system, although some challenges still remain. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2021-02-07 01:18:22","2021-02-07 01:18:22","","","254","","1224 CCIS","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 260 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50726-8_33","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Humanoid robot; Machine translation; Natural language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UGC as a text is notoriously difficult to process due to prompt introduction of neologisms, peculiar spelling, code-switching or transliteration. All of this increases lexical variety, thereby aggravating the most prominent problems of NLP, such as out-of-vocabulary lexica and data sparseness. It has been shown that certain preprocessing, known as lexical normalization or simply normalization, is required for them to work properly. We applied machine translation techniques to normalize Kazakh texts. For this, a parallel corpus was created with a set of aligned sentences in canonical and non-canonical forms. Using these comments, we created the phrase-based statistical machine translation system as a baseline system. Furthermore, we applied word-based sequence-sequence model to the normalization task. The former method shows 21.67 BLEUs on the test set, whereas later one obtained approximately 30 BLEU score. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

Although early statistical approaches to system combination have been proven effective in analyzing the consensus between hypotheses, they suffer from the error propagation problem due to the use of pipelines. While this problem has been alleviated by end-to-end training of multi-source sequence-to-sequence models recently, these neural models do not explicitly analyze the relations between hypotheses and fail to capture their agreement because the attention to a word in a hypothesis is calculated independently, ignoring the fact that the word might occur in multiple hypotheses. In this work, we propose an approach to modeling voting for system combination in machine translation. The basic idea is to enable words in hypotheses from different systems to vote on words that are representative and should get involved in the generation process. This can be done by quantifying the influence of each voter and its preference for each candidate. Our approach combines the advantages of statistical and neural methods since it can not only analyze the relations between hypotheses but also allow for end-to-end training. Experiments show that our approach is capable of better taking advantage of the consensus between hypotheses and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and English-German machine translation tasks. © 2020 Inst.

In response to these problems, we present a conceptually simple and empirically effective data augmentation approach in lexical constrained neural machine translation.

NMT models are generally trained with word-level learning objective, but evaluated by sentence-level metrics. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss function discourages model to generate synonymous predictions and overcorrect them to ground truth words. To address these two drawbacks, we adopt multi-task learning and propose a mixed learning objective (MLO) which combines the strength of word-level and sentence-level evaluation without modifying model structure. At word-level, it calculates semantic similarity between predicted and ground truth words. At sentence-level, it computes probabilistic n-gram matching scores of generated translations. We also combine a loss-sensitive scheduled sampling decoding strategy with MLO to explore its extensibility. Experimental results on IWSLT 2016 German-English and WMT 2019 English-Chinese datasets demonstrate that our methodology can significantly promote translation quality. The ablation study shows that both word-level and sentence-level learning objectives can improve BLEU scores.

Neural machine translation (NMT) models need large bilingual parallel corpora to perform training. However, in many languages or domains, such corpora are scarce. Therefore, the technology of unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) which does not need bilingual parallel corpora attracted wide interest. State-of-the-art UNMT models use Transformer for training and cannot learn the syntactic knowledge from the corpora. In this paper, we propose a method to improve UNMT by using dependency relationships extracted from dependency parsing. The extracted dependency relationships are concatenated with the original training data after Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to obtain new sentence representations for UNMT training. Models that combine dependency relationships allow for a better understanding of the underlying syntactic structure in sentences and thus affect the quality of UNMT. We leverage linearized parsing trees of the training sentences in order to incorporate syntax into the Transformer architecture without modifying it.

Specifically, we train several attention heads to attend to phrases in either n-gram or syntactic formalism. Moreover, we exploit interactions among phrases to enhance the strength of structure modeling - a commonly-cited weakness of self-attention.

The novelty of the proposed technology for solving the problem of unknown words in the neural machine translation of the Kazakh language is the proposed algorithm for searching of unknown words in the vocabulary of a trained model of neural machine translation using the dictionary of synonyms of the Kazakh language. A dictionary of synonyms is used to search for words that are similar in meaning to the unknown words, which was defined. Moreover, the found synonyms are checked for the presence in the vocabulary of a trained model of neural machine translation. After that, a new translation of the edited sentence of the source language is performed. The base of words-synonyms of the Kazakh language is collected. The total number of synonymous words collected is 1995. Software solutions to the unknown word problem have been developed in the python programming language.

Named entity translation is to realize the switching between entities in two languages, which can be used by browsers, translators, etc., and can greatly reduce the cost of communication between people from all over the world. Due to the immaturity of the existing translation model technology and the lack of integration, the translation of bilingual named entities with unique composition is very challenging. Based on this, this paper proposes a fusion method of bilingual entity class named entity translation based on chunk symmetry strategy and English–Chinese transliteration model based on machine learning strategy. According to the bilingual corpus, a more standard candidate entity translation pair is generated through bilingual named entity alignment. The transliteration model is used to reorder and correct the candidate translation results, so as to achieve the correct selection of translation pairs. Experiments show that the model based on the translation of named entity translations based on chunks and transliteration models based on machine learning strategies not only effectively solves the problem of difficulty in word ordering and selection in bilingual translation, but also makes extraction to a certain extent. The accuracy of the translation results has been improved. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2020","2021-02-07 01:19:39","2021-02-07 01:19:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Chunk symmetry strategy; Machine translation; Machine transliteration model; Named entity translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since AT and NAT can share model structure and AT is an easier task than NAT due to the explicit dependency on previous target-side tokens, a natural idea is to gradually shift the model training from the easier AT task to the harder NAT task. To smooth the shift from AT training to NAT training, in this paper, we introduce semi-autoregressive translation (SAT) as intermediate tasks. SAT contains a hyperparameter k, and each k value defines a SAT task with different degrees of parallelism. Specially, SAT covers AT and NAT as its special cases: it reduces to AT when k = 1 and to NAT when k = N (N is the length of target sentence). We design curriculum schedules to gradually shift k from 1 to N, with different pacing functions and number of tasks trained at the same time. We called our method as task-level curriculum learning for NAT (TCL-NAT). Experiments on IWSLT14 De-En, IWSLT16 En-De, WMT14 En-De and De-En datasets show that TCL-NAT achieves significant accuracy improvements over previous NAT baselines and reduces the performance gap between NAT and AT models to 1-2 BLEU points, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2020 Inst.

Although difficult to achieve from training data alone, it is possible to leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to retain source-language semantic relations in the corresponding target-language translation. The core idea is to use KG entity relations as embedding constraints to improve the mapping from source to target. This paper describes two embedding constraints, both of which employ Entity Linking (EL)—assigning a unique identity to entities—to associate words in training sentences with those in the KG: (1) a monolingual embedding constraint that supports an enhanced semantic representation of the source words through access to relations between entities in a KG; and (2) a bilingual embedding constraint that forces entity relations in the source-language to be carried over to the corresponding entities in the target-language translation. The method is evaluated for English-Spanish translation exploiting Freebase as a source of knowledge. Our experimental results demonstrate that exploiting KG information not only decreases the number of unknown words in the translation but also improves translation quality. © 2020 Author(s).

For example, a smartphone display can translate and text-augment information for travelers, assist with translation of signs, restaurant menus, medical documents, etc., and facilitate real-time translation of foreign-language lectures for students. However, NMT has been neglected in AR research because of its quality and performance requirements. General-purpose translation services, e.g., Google Translate, are used in some AR systems, but they depend on Internet connections and are not well-tuned to providing high-quality translation in specific domains. We propose a laboratory tool prototype that classifies phone camera images, recognizes and translates image text, and augments camera images with translated text in real time. Text from various domains is translated via NMT based on recurrent and convolutional neural networks-with and without subword units.

Different from the previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CAPSNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CAPSNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system.

Thus, specialized evaluation measures are needed. With this aim in mind, we contribute an extensive, targeted dataset that can be used as a test suite for pronoun translation, covering multiple source languages and different pronoun errors drawn from real system translations, for English.

Observing that weakly paired bilingual documents are much easier to collect than bilingual sentences, e.g., from Wikipedia, news websites or books, in this paper, we investigate training translation models with weakly paired bilingual documents. Our approach contains two components. 1) We provide a simple approach to mine implicitly bilingual sentence pairs from document pairs which can then be used as supervised training signals. 2) We leverage the topic consistency of two weakly paired documents and learn the sentence translation model by constraining the word distribution-level alignments.

Inspired by recent theoretic advances in deep learning, the paper understands DA from two perspectives towards the generalization ability of a model: input sensitivity and prediction margin, which are defined independent of specific test set thereby may lead to findings with relatively low variance.

In this paper, we conduct a series of analyses to deeply understand this problem and get several interesting findings. (1) The role of error propagation on accuracy drop is overstated in the literature, although it indeed contributes to the accuracy drop problem. (2) Characteristics of a language play a more important role in causing the accuracy drop: the left part of the translation result in a right-branching language (e.g., English) is more likely to be more accurate than its right part, while the right part is more accurate for a left-branching language (e.g., Japanese).

With the simple addition and subtraction operation, we introduce a twin-gated mechanism to build input and forget gates which are highly correlated. Despite this simplification, the essential non-linearities and capability of modeling long-distance dependencies are preserved. Additionally, the proposed ATR is more transparent than LSTM/GRU due to the simplification. Forward self-attention can be easily established in ATR, which makes the proposed network interpretable. Experiments on WMT14 translation tasks demonstrate that ATR-based neural machine translation can yield competitive performance on English-German and English-French language pairs in terms of both translation quality and speed.

Intuitively, words in a sentence are related to its domain to varying degrees, so that they will exert disparate impacts on the multi-domain NMT modeling. Based on this intuition, in this paper, we devote to distinguishing and exploiting word-level domain contexts for multi-domain NMT. To this end, we jointly model NMT with monolingual attention-based domain classification tasks and improve NMT as follows: 1) Based on the sentence representations produced by a domain classifier and an adversarial domain classifier, we generate two gating vectors and use them to construct domain-specific and domain-shared annotations, for later translation predictions via different attention models; 2) We utilize the attention weights derived from target-side domain classifier to adjust the weights of target words in the training objective, enabling domain-related words to have greater impacts during model training.

However, this theoretical argument has not been tested empirically, nor have alternative explanations for their strong performance been explored in-depth. We hypothesize that the strong performance of CNNs and self-attentional networks could also be due to their ability to extract semantic features from the source text, and we evaluate RNNs, CNNs and self-attention networks on two tasks: subject-verb agreement (where capturing long-range dependencies is required) and word sense disambiguation (where semantic feature extraction is required). Our experimental results show that: 1) self-attentional networks and CNNs do not outperform RNNs in modeling subject-verb agreement over long distances; 2) self-attentional networks perform distinctly better than RNNs and CNNs on word sense disambiguation. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics","2020","2021-02-07 01:20:41","2021-02-07 01:20:41","","4263-4272","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :26</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we show that the modeling problem can be solved by standard sequence-to-sequence architectures of sufficient depth, and that deep models operating at the character level outperform identical models operating over word fragments. This result implies that alternative architectures for handling character input are better viewed as methods for reducing computation time than as improved ways of modeling longer sequences. From this perspective, we evaluate several techniques for character-level NMT, verify that they do not match the performance of our deep character baseline model, and evaluate the performance versus computation time tradeoffs they offer. Within this framework, we also perform the first evaluation for NMT of conditional computation over time, in which the model learns which timesteps can be skipped, rather than having them be dictated by a fixed schedule specified before training begins. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics","2020","2021-02-07 01:20:49","2021-02-07 01:20:49","","4295-4305","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It allows software companies to access foreign markets that would be otherwise difficult to penetrate. Many studies have been carried out to locate need-to-translate strings in software and adapt UI layout after text translation in the new language. However, no work has been done on the most important and time-consuming step of software localization process, i.e., the translation of software text. Due to some unique characteristics of software text, for example, application-specific meanings, context-sensitive translation, domain-specific rare words, general machine translation tools such as Google Translate cannot properly address linguistic and technical nuance in translating software text for software localization. In this paper, we propose a neural-network based translation model specifically designed and trained for mobile application text translation. We collect large-scale human-translated bilingual sentence pairs inside different Android applications, which are crawled from Google Play store. We customize the original RNN encoder-decoder neural machine translation model by adding categorical information addressing the domain-specific rare word problem which is common phenomenon in software text. We evaluate our approach in translating the text of testing Android applications by both BLEU score and exact match rate.

To overcome this inferior behavior, we propose to de-Train a trained ConvS2S model in a mild way and retrain to find a better solution globally. In particular, the trained parameters of one layer of the NMT network are abandoned by re-initialization while other layers' parameters are kept at the same time to kick off re-optimization from a new start point and safeguard the new start point not too far from the previous optimum. This procedure is executed layer by layer until all layers of the ConvS2S model are explored. Experiments show that when compared to various measures for escaping from the local optimum, including initialization with random seeds, adding perturbations to the baseline parameters, and continuing training (con-Training) with the baseline models, our method consistently improves the ConvS2S translation quality across various language pairs and achieves better performance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","2019","2021-02-07 01:21:01","2021-02-07 01:21:01","","","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","ConvS2S; Local optimum; Neural machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we explore two ways to alleviate the UNK problem in NMT: a new generative adversarial network (added value constraints and semantic enhancement) and a preprocessing technique that mixes morphological noise. The training process is like a win-win game in which the players are three adversarial sub models (generator, filter, and discriminator). In this game, the filter is to emphasize the discriminator's attention to the negative generations that contain noise and improve the training efficiency. Finally, the discriminator cannot easily discriminate the negative samples generated by the generator with filter and human translations.

However, parallel training corpora are not always readily available. Moreover, out-of-vocabulary words - -mostly entities and terminological expressions - -pose a difficult challenge to Neural Machine Translation systems. Recent efforts have tried to alleviate the data sparsity problem by augmenting the training data using different strategies, such as external knowledge injection. In this paper, we hypothesize that knowledge graphs enhance the semantic feature extraction of neural models, thus optimizing the translation of entities and terminological expressions in texts and consequently leading to better translation quality. We investigate two different strategies for incorporating knowledge graphs into neural models without modifying the neural network architectures. Additionally, we examine the effectiveness of our augmented models on domain-specific texts and ontologies.

It is computationally more demanding than well-studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Also, in contrast to CNNs, RNNs heavily mix compute and memory bound layers which requires careful tuning on a latency machine to optimally use fast on-die memories for best single processor performance. Additionally, due to massive compute demand, it is essential to distribute the entire workload among several processors and even compute nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which attempts to scale this application on an Intel CPU cluster. Our CPU-based GNMT optimization, the first of its kind, achieves this by the following steps: (i) we choose a monolithic long short-term memory (LSTM) cell implementation from LIBXSMM library (specifically tuned for CPUs) and integrate it into TensorFlow, (ii) we modify GNMT code to use fused time step LSTM op for the encoding stage, (iii) we combine Horovod and Intel MLSL scaling libraries for improved performance on multiple nodes, and (iv) we extend the bucketing logic for grouping similar length sentences together to multiple nodes for achieving load balance across multiple ranks. In summary, we demonstrate that due to these changes we are able to outperform Google's stock CPU-based GNMT implementation by ~2x on single node and potentially enable more than 25x speedup using 16 node CPU cluster. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2021-02-07 01:21:11","2021-02-07 01:21:11","","","","","2019-September","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Intel architecture; LIBXSMM; machine translation; recurrent neural networks; TensorFlow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing, ICCC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the Asian language pairs-Japanese, Indonesian, Malay paired with Vietnamese-they are also not excluded from the case, in which there are no large bilingual corpora on these low-resource language pairs. Furthermore, although the languages are widely used in the world, there is no prior work on MT, which causes an issue for the development of MT on these languages. In this article, we conducted an empirical study of leveraging additional resources to improve MT for the Asian low-resource language pairs: Translation fromJapanese, Indonesian, andMalay to Vietnamese.We propose an innovative approach that lies in two strategies of building bilingual corpora from comparable data and phrase pivot translation on existing bilingual corpora of the languages paired with English.

For the biblical resource, subword unit translation for verbs and copy-able approach for nouns were applied to correct inconsistencies in translation. This correction mechanism was applied as a preprocessing technique. On the other hand, for Wikipedia being the main web resource, commonly occurring topic segments were extracted from both the source and the target languages. These observed topic segments are unique in 4 different categories. The identification of these topic segments may be used for automatic extraction of sentences.

The advantage of estimating MT quality at the word level is that this information can be used to guide post-editors since it enables the identification of the specific words in T that need to be edited in order to ease their work. However, word-level MT QE, as defined in the current literature, has an obvious limitation: it does not identify the positions in T in which missing words need to be inserted. To deal with this limitation, we propose a method which identifies both word deletions and insertion positions in T. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach allowing the identification of insertion positions in word-level MT QE. The method proposed can use any source of bilingual information – such as MT, dictionaries, or phrase-level translation memories – to extract features that are then used by a neural network to produce a prediction for both words and insertion positions (gaps between words) in the translation T. In this paper, several feature sets and neural network architectures are explored and evaluated on publicly-available datasets used in previous evaluation campaigns for word-level MT QE. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach, as well as the usefulness of sharing information between the two prediction tasks in order to obtain more reliable quality estimations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2021-02-07 01:21:40","2021-02-07 01:21:40","","174-192","","","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine translation; Quality estimation; Word-level quality estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a hybrid method, integrating corpus based approach and statistical approach for translating Bengali sentences into English with the help of N-gram language model. The corpus based method finds the corresponding target language translation of sentence fragments, selecting the best match text from the bilingual corpus to acquire knowledge while the N-gram model rearranges the sentence constituents to get an accurate translation without employing external linguistic rules. A variety of Bengali sentences, including various structures and verb tenses are considered to translate through the new system.

However, QE suffers heavily from the fact that the quality annotation data remain expensive and small. In this paper, we focus on the limited QE data problem and seek to find how to utilize the high level latent features learned by the pre-trained language models for improving QE. Specifically, we explore three strategies to integrate the pre-trained language representations into QE models: (1) a mixed integration model, where the pre-trained language features are mixed with other features for QE; (2) a direct integration model, which regards the pre-trained language model as the only feature extracting component of the entire QE model; and (3) a constrained integration model, where a constraint mechanism is added to optimize the quality prediction based on the direct integration model.

Various machine translation systems (MTS) have been developed for numerous languages. Sanskrit is one of the oldest languages in the world and is still in existence.

However, directly applying the MT model to CWS task would introduce translation errors and result in poor word segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Translation Correcting to solve this problem. Based on the differences between CWS and MT, Translation Correcting eliminates translation errors by utilizing the information of a sentence that needs to be segmented during the translation process. Consequently, the performance of word segmentation is considerably improved. Additionally, We get a new model called CWSTransformer, which is obtained by improving the MT model Transformer using Translation Correcting. The experiment compares the performances of CWSTransformer, Transformer and the previous translation-based CWS model on the benchmark datasets, PKU and MSR.

To the best of our knowledge, the system is trained on the largest dataset of more than three million tokens each side in English↔Bangla translation task. In the system, we perform data preprocessing and use optimized parameters to produce efficient system output. We analyze our system output from several viewpoints: overall results, comparisons with the available systems, sentence type and length effect, and behaviour of two challenging linguistic properties- prepositional phrase and noun inflection. Our analysis provides useful insights that translating into morphologically richer language is harder than translating from them and this is mainly due to the difficulties of translating noun inflections. Comparisons with the available systems show that our system outperforms the other systems significantly and gain 10.84 BLEU, 2.18 NIST and 19.02 TER points over the next best system.

Specifically, the algorithm learns the probability of a part (individual layer representations) assigned to a whole (aggregated representations) in an iterative way and combines parts accordingly. We implement our algorithm on top of the state-of-the-art neural machine translation model TRANSFORMER and conduct experiments on the widely-used WMT14 English-German and WMT17 Chinese-English translation datasets.

However, neural machine translation has been less tested for English-Bangla language pair, two linguistically distant and widely spoken languages. In this paper, we apply neural machine translation to the task of English-Bangla translation in both directions and compare it against a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system. We obtain up to +0.30 and +4.95 BLEU improvement over phrase-based statistical machine translation for English-to-Bangla and Bangla-to-English respectively. Due to low-resource and morphological richness of Bangla, English-Bangla translation task produces a large number of rare words. We apply subword segmentation with byte pair encoding to handle this rare words issue. We obtain up to +0.69 and +0.30 BLEU improvement over baseline neural machine translation for English-to-Bangla and Bangla-to-English respectively. We further investigate our system output for several challenging linguistic properties like subject-verb agreement, noun inflection, long distance reordering and rare words translation. We observe that neural machine translation with and without subword segmentation significantly outperform the phrase-based statistical machine translation system, thus establishing itself as the state-of-the-art technology for low-resource English-Bangla machine translation. © 2019 Mohammad Abdullah Al Mumin, Md Hanif Seddiqui, Muhammed Zafar Iqbal and Mohammed Jahirul Islam.","2019","2021-02-07 01:22:12","2021-02-07 01:22:12","","1627-1637","","11","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","English-bangla machine translation; Low-resource; Morphologically rich; Neural machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we compare various monolingual selection methods, different model performance, pseudo-data and parallel corpus ratios, and different data generation methods for the validity of pseudo-data in machine translation tasks. Experiments on Lithuanian and Gujarati, two low-resource languages have shown that increasing the distribution of low-frequency words and increasing data diversity are more effective for models with sufficient training, while the results of insufficient models are opposite. In this paper, different back-translation strategies are used for different languages, and compared with common back-translation methods in WMT news tasks of two languages, and the effectiveness of the strategies is verified by experiments.

It is a language in its own right as well as spoken languages such as Arabic or English. It is produced by body, face, and gestures of the hands. Hundreds of thousands of deaf people around the world currently practice it. Each country has its own sign language that deaf people use so it is not universal, but deaf people from different countries communicate easily with each other after a short period of adaptation. This communication becomes difficult when a deaf want to communicate with a normal person with no interpreter available. In this way, building a translation system that can generate real-time statements via a signing avatar is helpful. The system to be developed is a machine translation system from Arabic text to the Arabic sign language, it will allow hearing persons to communicate more easily, using a text written in Arabic by normal person, with people suffering from hard hearing and knowing only sign language. The system must perform a morpho-syntactic analysis of the text in the input and convert it to video sequences phrases playing by a 3D human avatar who expresses the usual signs used by deaf people. In this paper, we present a first version of our machine translation system ATLASLang MTS 1 based on rule-based Interlingua and example-based approaches. It uses SAFAR Platform [11] and ALKHALIL morpho system [1] to extract the morphological properties of each word of the input sentence. Then it generates a video sequence representing the sentence in Arabic sign language based on well-established translation rules and the database of signs. During the translation, if a word of sentence is a proper noun or does not have a correspondence in the database, it will be finger spelled. The main constraint imposed by our machine translation system is the assumption that the sentence given in the input must be completely vowelized. © 2019 The Authors.","2019","2021-02-07 01:22:38","2021-02-07 01:22:38","","236-245","","","148","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Arabic Language; Arabic Sign Language; Deaf People; Hearing Impaired; Machine Translation System; Natural Language Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Procedia Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main idea is utilizing the entity relations in knowledge graph as constraints to enhance the connections between the source words and their translations. Specifically, we design two kinds of constraints. One is monolingual constraint that employs the entity relations in KG to augment the semantic representation of the source words. The other is bilingual constraint which enforces the entity relations between the source words to be shared by their translations.

However, due to weak supervision, the pseudo data inevitably contain noises and errors that will be accumulated and reinforced in the subsequent training process, leading to bad translation performance. To address this issue, we introduce phrase based Statistic Machine Translation (SMT) models which are robust to noisy data, as posterior regularizations to guide the training of unsupervised NMT models in the iterative back-translation process. Our method starts from SMT models built with pre-trained language models and word-level translation tables inferred from cross-lingual embeddings. Then SMT and NMT models are optimized jointly and boost each other incrementally in a unified EM framework. In this way, (1) the negative effect caused by errors in the iterative back-translation process can be alleviated timely by SMT filtering noises from its phrase tables; meanwhile, (2) NMT can compensate for the deficiency of fluency inherent in SMT. Experiments conducted on en-fr and en-de translation tasks show that our method outperforms the strong baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation performance. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

To address this issue, we propose a novel model regularization method for NMT training, which aims to improve the agreement between translations generated by left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) NMT decoders. This goal is achieved by introducing two Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the NMT training objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of L2R and R2L models. In addition, we also employ a joint training strategy to allow L2R and R2L models to improve each other in an interactive update process. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

These new systems are generated based on a bilingual phrase semantic representation model. Specifically, the Uyghur-Chinese bilingual phrase bilinear semantic similarity score and cosine semantic similarity score were firstly computed by a bilingual phrase semantic representation model and then several new systems were generated by adding features to the original feature set of the phrase-based translation model by static features and dynamic features.

Most recently, with advanced modeling and training techniques, the RNN-based NMT (RNMT) has shown its potential strength, even compared with the well-known Transformer (self-attentional) model. Although the RNMT model can possess very deep architectures through stacking layers, the transition depth between consecutive hidden states along the sequential axis is still shallow. In this paper, we further enhance the RNN-based NMT through increasing the transition depth between consecutive hidden states and build a novel Deep Transition RNN-based Architecture for Neural Machine Translation, named DTMT. This model enhances the hidden-to-hidden transition with multiple non-linear transformations, as well as maintains a linear transformation path throughout this deep transition by the well-designed linear transformation mechanism to alleviate the gradient vanishing problem. Experiments show that with the specially designed deep transition modules, our DTMT can achieve remarkable improvements on translation quality. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation task show that DTMT can outperform the Transformer model by +2.09 BLEU points and achieve the best results ever reported in the same dataset.

The effect of these linguistic features for the proper classification of the senses (postposition in Malayalam) is studied with the help of several machine learning algorithms. The study showed that, the classification accuracy is higher when both verb and noun class features are taken into consideration. In linguistics, the major factor that decides the sense of the preposition is the noun in the prepositional phrase.

Intelligent systems especially natural language processing systems can show different results in terms of performance and precision when moving among genres and domains. Therefore researchers have explored different language model adaptation strategies in order to overcome effectiveness issue. There are two main categories in language model adaptation techniques. The first category includes the techniques that based on the data selection where task-oriented corpus can be extracted and used to train and generate models for specific translations. While the second category focuses on developing a weighting criterion to assign the test data to specific model corpus. The purpose of this research is to introduce language model adaptation approach that combines both categories (data selection and weighting criterion) of language model adaptation. This approach applies data selection for specific-task translations by dividing the corpus into smaller and topic-related corpora using clustering process. We investigate the effect of different approaches for clustering the bilingual data on the language model adaptation process in terms of translation quality using the Europarl corpus WMT07 that includes bilingual data for English-Spanish, English-German and English-French.

To further improve the translation efficiency, there is an increasing interest in applying machine translation (MT) technology to upgrade CAT. To thoroughly integrate MT into CAT systems, in this article, we propose a novel approach: a new input method that makes full use of the knowledge adopted by MT systems, such as translation rules, decoding hypotheses, and n-best translation lists. The proposed input method contains two parts: a phrase generation model, allowing human translators to type target sentences quickly, and an n-gram prediction model, helping users choose perfect MT fragments smoothly. In addition, to tune the underlying MT system to generate the input method preferable results, we design a new evaluation metric for the MT system. The proposed input method integrates MT effectively and imperceptibly, and it is particularly suitable for many target languages with complex characters, such as Chinese and Japanese. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method saves more than 23% in time and over 42% in keystrokes, and it also improves the translation quality by more than 5 absolute BLEU scores compared with the strong baseline, i.e., post-editing using Google Pinyin. © 2018 ACM","2018","2021-02-07 01:23:19","2021-02-07 01:23:19","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Computer-aided translation; Evaluation metric; Input method; Machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a method to select languages to be used with machine translators, and a way of creating the best-balanced communication environment. Many studies have addressed machine translation with the goal of helping the non-native speaker to understand what was said. Our approach is totally differently, since we focus on helping the non-native speaker by enhancing the opportunity to join in the conversation. We conduct an experiment and find that this model allows machine translation technologies to benefit multilingual communication while making best use of the participants’ different language skills.

These messages describe the content and purposes of changes, hence are useful for program comprehension and software maintenance. However, due to the lack of time and direct motivation, commit messages sometimes are neglected by developers. To address this problem, Jiang et al. proposed an approach (we refer to it as NMT), which leverages a neural machine translation algorithm to automatically generate short commit messages from code. The reported performance of their approach is promising, however, they did not explore why their approach performs well. Thus, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of their experimental results. We find that (1) Most of the test diffs from which NMT can generate high-quality messages are similar to one or more training diffs at the token level. (2) About 16% of the commit messages in Jiang et al.'s dataset are noisy due to being automatically generated or due to them describing repetitive trivial changes. (3) The performance of NMT declines by a large amount after removing such noisy commit messages. In addition, NMT is complicated and time-consuming. Inspired by our first finding, we proposed a simpler and faster approach, named NNGen (Nearest Neighbor Generator), to generate concise commit messages using the nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experimental results show that NNGen is over 2,600 times faster than NMT, and outperforms NMT in terms of BLEU (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate machine translation systems) by 21%. Finally, we also discuss some observations for the road ahead for automated commit message generation to inspire other researchers. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","2018","2021-02-07 01:23:24","2021-02-07 01:23:24","","373-384","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :33</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Commit message generation; Nearest neighbor algorithm; Neural machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASE 2018 - Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most existing methods suffer from two obvious drawbacks. First, they only focus on simple contexts such as an entire document or a fixed-sized sliding window to build word embedding and ignore latent useful information from the selected context. Second, the word sense but not the word should be the minimal semantic unit; however, most existing methods still use word representation. To overcome these drawbacks, this article presents a novel Graph-Based Bilingual Word Embedding (GBWE) method that projects bilingual word senses into a multidimensional semantic space. First, a bilingual word co-occurrence graph is constructed using the co-occurrence and pointwise mutual information between the words. Then, maximum complete subgraphs (cliques), which play the role of a minimal unit for bilingual sense representation, are dynamically extracted according to the contextual information. Consequently, correspondence analysis, principal component analyses, and neural networks are used to summarize the clique-word matrix into lower dimensions to build the embedding model. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

We investigate how children use various information such as nonverbal cues and drawings to compensate for the mistranslations of MT.

In this paper, we collect ∼200,000 sentence pairs and show that with this middle-scale database, an attention-based NMT can perform very well on Chinese-Uyghur/Uyghur-Chinese translation. To tackle rare words, we propose a novel memory structure to assist the NMT inference.

A potential problem of the existing NMT algorithm, however, is that the decoding is conducted from left to right, without considering the right context. This paper proposes an two-stage approach to solve the problem. In the first stage, a conventional attention-based NMT system is used to produce a draft translation, and in the second stage, a novel double-attention NMT system is used to refine the translation, by looking at the original input as well as the draft translation. This drafting-and-refinement can obtain the right-context information from the draft, hence producing more consistent translations. We evaluated this approach using two Chinese-English translation tasks, one with 44k pairs and 1M pairs respectively.

Our method is able to deal with phrases of arbitrary length and to find phrase pairs that are useful for statistical machine translation, without requiring large parallel or comparable corpora. First, our method generates phrase pairs through coupling source and target phrases separately collected from respective monolingual data. Then, for each phrase pair, we compute features using the monolingual data and a small quantity of parallel sentences. Finally, incorrect phrase pairs are pruned, and a phrase table is made using the remaining phrase pairs. In our experiments on French-Japanese and Spanish-Japanese translation tasks under low-resource conditions, we observe that incorporating a phrase table induced by our method to the machine translation system leads to large improvements in translation quality. Furthermore, we show that a phrase table induced by our method can also be useful in a wide range of configurations, including configurations where we have already access to large parallel corpora and configurations where only small monolingual corpora are available. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Although neural machine translation has recently become a dominant paradigm and achieved great progress, it still has to confront with the challenge of word sense disambiguation. Neural machine translation models are trained to identify the correct sense of a word as part of an end-to-end translation task, and their performances on word sense disambiguation are not satisfactory. This paper presents a case study of machine translation for Korean language. We have manually built a Korean lexical semantic network -UWordMap -as a large-scale lexical semantic knowledge-based in which each sense of every polysemous word is associated with a sense-code constituting a network node. Then, based on UWordMap, we determine the correct sense and tag the appropriated sense-code for polysemous words of the training corpus before training neural machine translation models. Experiments on translation from Korean to English and Vietnamese show that UWordMap can significantly improve quality of Korean neural machine translation systems in terms of BLEU and TER cores. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

As a key part of the proposed algorithm we introduce the ‘Root alignment’ principle to extract potential sub-words from a corpus, as well as a special technique for constructing words from potential sub-words. We conducted experiments with two different neural machine translation systems, training them on parallel corpora for English-Latvian and Latvian-English translation. Evaluation of translation quality showed improvements in BLEU scores when the data were pre-processed using the proposed algorithm, compared to a couple of baseline word segmentation algorithms. Although we were able to demonstrate improvements in both translation directions and for both NMT systems, they were relatively minor, and our experiments show that machine translation with inflected languages remains challenging, especially with translation direction towards a highly inflected language. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","2018","2021-02-07 01:24:05","2021-02-07 01:24:05","","","289","","838","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 301 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-97571-9_23","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Neural machine translation; Processing morphologically rich languages; Word segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of recent work handled such a problem by splitting words into characters or other specially extracted subword units to enable open-vocabulary translation. Byte pair encoding (BPE) is one of the successful attempts that has been shown extremely competitive by providing effective subword segmentation for NMT systems.

To this end, our proposed method first groups source and target words into a set of hierarchical clusters, then a sequence of NMT models are learned based on it with growing cluster granularity. Each subsequent model inherits model parameters from its previous one and refines them with finer-grained word-cluster mapping.

Large Berber-speaking migrant communities have been living in Western Europe since the 1950s. In this paper, we study the Standard Moroccan Amazigh. It became a constitutionally official language of Morocco, in 2011. However, it is still considered as a less resourced language. So, it is time to develop linguistic resources and applications for processing automatically this language, in order to ensure its survival and promotion by integrating it into the new information and communication technologies (NICT). In this context and in the perspective to produce a Universal Networking Language (UNL) based machine translation system for this language, we have undertaken the creation of the Amazigh-UNL dictionary, as a first step of linguistic resources' development required by the UNL system to achieve translation.

Due to the large number of word and sequence combinations, a parallel dataset is required, which unfortunately is not always available, particularly for low resource languages. Therefore, we adapted a character neural translation model that was based on a combined structure of recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network.

Specifically, I consider two tasks: given pair of sentences in Russian – classify them into two (non-paraphrases, paraphrases) or three (non-paraphrases, near-paraphrases, precise-paraphrases) classes. I compare five different well-established sentence similarity methods developed in English and three different Machine Translation engines (Google, Microsoft and Yandex). I perform detailed ablation tests to identify the contribution of each component of the five methods, and identify the best combination of Machine Translation and sentence similarity method, including ensembles, on the Russian Paraphrase data set.

An effective approach to compensate for this requirement is MultiTask Learning (MTL) to leverage different linguistic resources as a source of inductive bias. Current MTL architectures are based on the SEQ2SEQ transduction, and (partially) share different components of the models among the tasks. However, this MTL approach often suffers from task interference, and is not able to fully capture commonalities among subsets of tasks. We address this issue by extending the recurrent units with multiple blocks along with a trainable routing network. The routing network enables adaptive collaboration by dynamic sharing of blocks conditioned on the task at hand, input, and model state.

In this work we take a fine-grained look at the different architectures for NMT. We introduce an Architecture Definition Language (ADL) allowing for a flexible combination of common building blocks. Making use of this language, we show in experiments that one can bring recurrent and convolutional models very close to the Transformer performance by borrowing concepts from the Transformer architecture, but not using self-attention. Additionally, we find that self-attention is much more important for the encoder side than for the decoder side, where it can be replaced by a RNN or CNN without a loss in performance in most settings.

Specifically, the latent random variables are included into the hidden states of the NMT decoder with elements from the variational autoencoder. In this way, these variables are recurrently generated, which enables them to further capture strong and complex dependencies among the output translations at different timesteps. In order to deal with the challenges in performing efficient posterior inference and large-scale training during the incorporation of latent variables, we build a neural posterior approximator, and equip it with a reparameterization technique to estimate the variational lower bound.

Since large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora are usually costly to collect, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Inspired by the law of total probability, which connects the probability of a given target-side monolingual sentence to the conditional probability of translating from a source sentence to the target one, we propose to explicitly exploit this connection to learn from and regularize the training of NMT models using monolingual data. The key technical challenge of this approach is that there are exponentially many source sentences for a target monolingual sentence while computing the sum of the conditional probability given each possible source sentence. We address this challenge by leveraging the dual translation model (target-to-source translation) to sample several mostly likely source-side sentences and avoid enumerating all possible candidate source sentences. That is, we transfer the knowledge contained in the dual model to boost the training of the primal model (source-to-target translation), and we call such an approach dual transfer learning. Experiment results on English→French and German→English tasks demonstrate that dual transfer learning achieves significant improvement over several strong baselines and obtains new state-of-the-art results.

We propose tools and metrics to assess how uncertainty in the data is captured by the model distribution and how it affects search strategies that generate translations.

However, several studies indicate that NMT often generates fluent but unfaithful translations. In this paper, we propose a method to alleviate this problem by using a phrase table as recommendation memory. The main idea is to add bonus to words worthy of recommendation, so that NMT can make correct predictions. Specifically, we first derive a prefix tree to accommodate all the candidate target phrases by searching the phrase translation table according to the source sentence. Then, we construct a recommendation word set by matching between candidate target phrases and previously translated target words by NMT.

However, most existing works focus on exploring internal relationship among words within phrases, which are lack of context information and not sufficient for phrase representation learning. To solve this problem, we propose a context-aware phrase representation learning framework, which extends the bilingually-constrained recursive autoencoder with context modeling component. By this way, we obtain context-aware phrase representation. Furthermore, for the word and topic form the base of the our model, we regard the word and topic as two different vertexes and construct a bipartite network. Thus, we naturally introduce the bipartite network embedding method to learn better word and topic embedding, which further improve the quality of the phrase representation.

The first challenge is prepossessing the highly noisy data collected from Twitter, for both the source and target languages. A special attention is given to the pre-processing of Arabic tweets. The second challenge is related to the lack of parallel corpora for Arabic-English tweets. Thus, an out-of-domain corpus was incorporated for training a translation model and an adaptation strategy of a bigger language model for English tweets was used in the training step. Our evaluations confirm that pre-processing tweets of the source and target languages improves the performance of the statistical machine translation system.

Firstly, the syntactic knowledge is acquired and added to paraphrase extraction algorithm as constraints to obtain higher quality paraphrases from a parallel corpora. Then the extracted paraphrases are used to update the phrase table and reordering table of the translation system based on the unknown words and phrases in the source-side sentences of the development set and test set. Specifically, if a paraphrase of an unknown word or phrase in a source-side sentence of the development set and test set exists in the phrase table or reordering table, then a new phrase pair constructed with this unknown word or phrase with the target-side word or phrase of this paraphrase will be added to the phrase table or reordering table. In doing so, it can reduce the number of our-of-vocabulary words, and improve the coverage of the test set by the paraphrase-enhanced tables.

Unfortunately, programmers often neglect to write good commit messages. Different techniques have been proposed to help programmers by automatically writing these messages. These techniques are effective at describing what changed, but are often verbose and lack context for understanding the rationale behind a change. In contrast, humans write messages that are short and summarize the high level rationale. In this paper, we adapt Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to automatically 'translate' diffs into commit messages. We trained an NMT algorithm using a corpus of diffs and human-written commit messages from the top 1k Github projects. We designed a filter to help ensure that we only trained the algorithm on higher-quality commit messages. Our evaluation uncovered a pattern in which the messages we generate tend to be either very high or very low quality. Therefore, we created a quality-assurance filter to detect cases in which we are unable to produce good messages, and return a warning instead. © 2017 IEEE.","2017","2021-02-07 01:25:35","2021-02-07 01:25:35","","135-146","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :57</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASE 2017 - Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The common approach for quality estimation is to treat the problem as a supervised regression/classification task using a qualityannotated noisy parallel corpus, called quality estimation data, as training data. However, the available size of quality estimation data remains small, due to the too-expensive cost of creating such data. In addition, most conventional quality estimation approaches rely on manually designed features to model nonlinear relationships between feature vectors and corresponding quality labels. To overcome these problems, this article proposes a novel neural network architecture for quality estimation task-called the predictor-estimator-that considersword prediction as an additional pre-task. The major component of the proposed neural architecture is a word prediction model based on a modified neural machine translation model-a probabilistic model for predicting a targetword conditioned on all the other source and target contexts. The underlying assumption is that the word prediction model is highly related to quality estimation models and is therefore able to transfer useful knowledge to quality estimation tasks. Our proposed quality estimation method sequentially trains the following two types of neural models: (1) Predictor: a neural word prediction model trained from parallel corpora and (2) Estimator: a neural quality estimation model trained fromquality estimation data. To transferword a prediction task to a quality estimation task, we generate quality estimation feature vectors from theword prediction model and feed them into the quality estimation model. The experimental results on WMT15 and 16 quality estimation datasets show that our proposed method has great potential in the various sub-challenges. © 2017 ACM.","2017","2021-02-07 01:25:47","2021-02-07 01:25:47","","","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :14</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Bidirectional language model; Feature extraction; Machine translation; Neural networks; Quality estimation; Word prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the NMT model being widely used in empirical productions, its long-standing weakness in handling the rare and out of vocabulary words has been amplified a lot. In order to release the model from the stress of 'understanding' the rare words, copy mechanism has been proposed to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. However the negative side of the copy mechanism is that the model is only able to decide whether to copy or not. It is unable to detect which class should the rare word be copied to, such as person, location, and organization. This paper deeply investigates this limitation of the NMT model. As a result, we propose a new NMT model by novelly incorporating a class-specific copy network. With the network, the proposed NMT model is able to decide which class the words in the target belong to and which class in the source should be copied to. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation tasks show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional NMT model with a large margin especially for sentences containing the rare words. © 2017 IEEE.","2017","2021-02-07 01:26:02","2021-02-07 01:26:02","","2658-2664","","","2017-May","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hindi is taken as regional language and is used for all types of official work in central government offices. Commencing such a vast number of people 80% of people know Hindi. Though Hindi is also regional language of Jabalpur, MP, India, still a lot of people of Jabalpur are unable to speak in Hindi. So for production those people unswerving to know Hindi language we expand a machine translation system.

The difficulty comes from the fact that translation is not a science but it is more an art; most of the sentences can be translated in many acceptable forms. Consequently, there is no such fix standard against which a particular translation can be evaluated. If it has been possible to make an independent algorithm that would be able to evaluate a specific Machine Translation, then the belief is that this evaluation algorithm will be a better algorithm than the translating algorithm itself. Initially, MT evaluation used to be done by human beings which was a time-consuming task and highly subjective too. Also evaluation results may vary from one human evaluator to another for the same sentence pair. Therefore we need automatic evaluation systems, which are quick and objective. Different methods for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation have been projected in recent years, out of which many of them have been accepted willingly by the MT community. In the proposed work, we have checked the applicability of BLEU metric and of its modified versions for English to Hindi Machine Translation(s) particularly for Agriculture Domain. Further, we have incorporated some additional features like synonym replacement and shallow parsing modules and after that we have calculated the final score by using BLEU and M-BLEU metrics. The sentences which have been tested are taken from Agriculture Domain. The BLEU metric does not consider the synonym problem and it considers synonym as different words thereby lowering down the final calculated score while comparing the human translations with the machine translations. To overcome this drawback of BLEU, we have incorporated a synonym replacement module in our algorithm. For this, first of all the word is replaced by its synonym present in any of the reference human translations and then it is compared with the reference human translation. © 2016 IEEE.","2017","2021-02-07 01:26:08","2021-02-07 01:26:08","","331-336","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceeding - IEEE International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation, ICCCA 2016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is designed for translation between very close languages, such as Czech and Slovak or Danish and Norwegian. It provides a low-quality translation in resource-poor scenarios where parallel data, required for training a high-quality translation system, may be scarce or unavailable. This is useful e.g. for cross-lingual NLP, where a trained model may be transferred from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target language via machine translation.

The target gender-bound constructs were subject-verb agreement, adjectival-noun agreement and pronoun-Antecedent agreement, which occurred naturally in four purposefully selected technical texts. The idea behind the choice of technical texts was to reduce the linguistic load found in other genres, such as literary texts, which involve utilising creative linguistic tools that are out of the scope of the present paper.

Our experiments show that the best results are achieved when applying a technique we call gradual fine-tuning, with improvements up to +2.6 BLEU over the original data selection approach and up to +3.1 BLEU over a general baseline. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2017","2021-02-07 01:26:24","2021-02-07 01:26:24","","1400-1410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :23</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMNLP 2017 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, NMT systems are limited in translating low-resource languages (LRL), due to the fact that neural methods require a large amount of parallel data to learn effective mappings between languages. In this work we show how so-called multilingual NMT can help to tackle the challenges associated with LRL translation. Multilingual NMT forces words and sub-words representation in a shared semantic space across multiple languages. This allows the model to utilize a positive parameter transfer between different languages, without changing the standard attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and training modality. We run preliminary experiments with three languages (English, Italian, Romanian) covering six translation directions and show that for all available directions the multilingual approach, i.e. just one system covering all directions is comparable or even outperforms the single bilingual systems. Finally, our approach achieve competitive results also for language pairs not seen at training time using a pivoting (x-step) translation.","2017","2021-02-07 01:26:25","2021-02-07 01:26:25","","","","","2006","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two MT engines are trained on an in-domain bilingual corpus and a subset of the Europarl corpus, and one of them is enhanced adding a bilingual termbase to its training data. Overall systems’ performance is assessed through the BLEU score, whereas the f-score is used to focus the evaluation on term translation. Furthermore, a manual analysis of the terms is carried out. Results suggest that in some cases - despite the simplistic approach implemented to inject terms into the MT system - the termbase was able to bias the word choice of the engine.","2017","2021-02-07 01:26:26","2021-02-07 01:26:26","","","","","2006","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper presented here describes the experiments carried out on corpus text pre-processing for building the baseline Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system. Text pre-processing performed here is classified in two stages – i. the first one relates to handling of orthographic representation of content and ii. the second stage relates to handling of non-lexical words. The first stage covers punctuation symbols, casing, word spellings and their normalization while second stage covers handling of numbers and named entities (NEs) applied on the best settings observed in first stage. The motivation behind performing these experiments was to derive a relationship and gauge the extent of pre-processing the corpus, thereby building a considerably optimized baseline SMT system. This baseline system would provide platform for performing further experiments with different syntactic and semantic factors in future. The findings presented here is for English-Hindi language pair, however, the concept of pre-processing is language neutral and can be transcended to any other language pair. The best performance is reported with retaining the punctuation symbols, lower-cased English corpus and spell normalized Hindi corpus for English to Hindi translation.

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a rapidly advancing MT paradigm and has shown promising results for many language pairs, especially in large training data scenario. We build 110 NMT systems for translation among 11 Indian languages - the first effort in the direction of NMT for Indian languages to the best of our knowledge. Also, since the condition of large parallel corpora is not met for most Indian languages, we propose a method to employ additional linguistic knowledge which is encoded by different phenomena depicted by Indian languages; like Vibhakti, Sandhi and so on. We compare the results obtained on incorporating this knowledge with the baseline systems and demonstrate significant performance improvement.

In an effort to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel content-based neural reordering model that estimates reordering probabilities based on the words of its surrounding contexts. We first utilize a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture semantic contents conditioned on various sizes of context. And then we employ a softmax layer to predict the reordering orientations and probability distributions.

Phrase structures are not the best way to explicitly model long distance dependencies. In this paper we propose a simple but effective method to incorporate source-side long distance dependencies into NMT.

This risk becomes particularly significant if users are transmitting their country's specific knowledge and know-how to exchange cultural information with users in other countries. To mitigate this risk, it is necessary for users to adapt to the translation services in order to improve the translation's accuracy. Thus, in this study we focused on the transmission effect of sharing technical knowledge with a user having a different mother tongue (Chinese) by using a machine translation service. We performed experiments simulating expert knowledge transmission classes and tasks with a system consisting of multilingual chats and a corpus of terminologies. Our evaluation of the transmission reveals how the Chinese knowledge receiver could have learned depending on the pattern of organizational structure and the level of detail of the information. We also found that the use of symbols and numbers was effective.

Therefore, word segmentation (WS) is usually the first process that is implemented in the machine translation process. WS in the source and target languages is based on different training corpora, and WS approaches may not be the same. Therefore, the WS that results in these two languages are not often homologous, and thus word alignment results in many 1-n and n-1 alignment pairs in statistical machine translation, which degrades the performance of machine translation. In this article, we will adjust the WS for both Chinese and Vietnamese in particular and for isolated language pairs in general and make the word boundary of the two languages more symmetric in order to strengthen 1-1 alignments and enhance machine translation performance. We have tested this method on the Computational Linguistics Center's corpus, which consists of 35,623 sentence pairs.

Existing methods use vector space models, word co-occurrence information, lexical databases, parsers and machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics to find text similarity. However, other aspects such as negations, inverse relations and semantic roles of the sentences are also very much important in identifying paraphrases. Furthermore, the semantics of the sentences are hidden when the sentences are complex. We propose an approach to find similarity between pair of texts by considering all these factors. We have used an approach to determine set of clauses present in the texts by resolving conjunctions in complex sentences that identify hidden triples from the text. The approach extracts clause-based similarity features namely concept score, relation score, proposition score and word score from the texts. We have combined these similarity features along with MT metrics features to identify whether the texts are paraphrases or not using Support Vector Machine model. We have evaluated our methodology to measure the paraphrase similarity for Microsoft Research corpus. The statistical tests namely k-fold paired t-test and McNemar's test show that including clause-based features significantly improved the performance.

The model labels nonterminals with classes of boundary words on the target side of aligned phrase pairs. Labeling of the rules is performed with coarse grained and fine grained nonterminals using POS tags and word clusters trained on the target language corpus. Considering the large size of the proposed model due to the diversity of nonterminals, we have also proposed a novel approach for filtered rule extraction based on the alignment pattern of phrase pairs. Using limited patterns of rules, the extraction of hierarchical rules gets restricted from phrase pairs that are decomposable to two aligned subphrases. The proposed filtered rule extraction decreases the model size and the decoding time considerably with no significant impact on the translation quality. Using BLEU as a metric in our experiments, the proposed model achieved a notable improvement rate over the state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based model in the translation from Persian, French and Spanish to English language.

Machine translation is a technology that uses software to translate from one natural language to another. The progress of machine translation systems has been steady in the last decade. As for now, machine translation technology is particularly appealing because it might be used, in the form of cross-language chat services, in countries that are entering into global software projects. However, despite the recent progress of the technology, we still lack a thorough understanding of how real-time machine translation affects communication. In this paper, we present a set of empirical studies with the goal of assessing to what extent real-time machine translation can be used in distributed, multilingual requirements meetings instead of English. Results suggest that, despite far from 100 % accurate, real-time machine translation is not disruptive of the conversation flow and, therefore, is accepted with favor by participants. However, stronger effects can be expected to emerge when language barriers are more critical. Our findings add to the evidence about the recent advances of machine translation technology and provide some guidance to global software engineering practitioners in regarding the losses and gains of using English as a lingua franca in multilingual group communication, as in the case of computer-mediated requirements meetings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2016","2021-02-07 01:27:23","2021-02-07 01:27:23","","1002-1034","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Computer-mediated communication; Controlled experiment; Distributed meetings; Global software development; Machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are multiple existing sentiment analysis methods that explore different techniques, usually relying on lexical resources or learning approaches. Despite the large interest on this theme and amount of research efforts in the field, almost all existing methods are designed to work with only English content. Most existing strategies in specific languages consist of adapting existing lexical resources, without presenting proper validations and basic baseline comparisons. In this paper, we take a different step into this field. We focus on evaluating existing efforts proposed to do language specific sentiment analysis. To do it, we evaluated twenty-one methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis proposed for English, comparing them with two language-specific methods. Based on nine language-specific datasets, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of existing multi-language approaches. Our main result suggests that simply translating the input text on a specific language to English and then using one of the existing English methods can be better than the existing language specific efforts evaluated. We also rank those implementations comparing their prediction performance and identifying the methods that acquired the best results using machine translation across different languages. As a final contribution to the research community, we release our codes and datasets.

This paper analyzed English-Chinese MT errors from the perspective of naming-telling clause (NT clause, hereafter). Two types of text were input to get the MT output: one was to input the whole original English sentences into an MT engine; the other was to parse English sentences into English NT clauses, and then input these clauses into the MT engine in order. The errors of MT output are categorized into three classes: incorrect lexical choices, structural errors and component omissions. Structural errors are further divided into SV-structure errors and non-SV-structure errors. The analyzed data shows firstly, the major errors are structural errors, in which non-SV-structural errors account for a larger proportion; secondly, translation errors decrease significantly after English sentences are parsed into NT clauses. This result reveals that non-SV clauses are the main source of MT errors, and suggests that English long sentences should be parsed into NT clauses before they are translated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","2016","2021-02-07 01:27:57","2021-02-07 01:27:57","","","35","","10035 LNAI","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 49 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-47674-2_4","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Error analysis; Machine translation; Non-SV clauses; NT clauses; SV clauses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an automatic algorithm for cross-lingual similarization of dependency grammars, which automatically learns grammars with high cross-lingual similarity. The algorithm similarizes the annotation styles of the dependency grammars for two languages in the level of classification decisions, and gradually improves the cross-lingual similarity without losing linguistic knowledge resorting to iterative cross-lingual cooperative learning. The dependency grammars given by cross-lingual similarization have much higher cross-lingual similarity while maintaining non-triviality. As applications, the cross-lingually similarized grammars significantly improve the performance of dependency tree-based machine translation. © 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics","2016","2021-02-07 01:28:08","2021-02-07 01:28:08","","501-510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMNLP 2016 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is why MT has proved to be extremely useful in various spoken and written text applications in reducing language barriers and facilitating cross-lingual information search as well as commerce and communication. With mobile apps such as Google Translate the possibility of understanding a sign in a foreign language, reading a hotel review, collaborating in social media, or interacting orally is now at your fingertips. Translating texts back and forth between 71 languages, this service was used about 200million times only last year. The quality of its translation, nevertheless, is still inconsistent. The system depends on a vast mass of parallel texts in order to correlate existing translations. Also, as in language learning, similarity of structures between languages in terms of grammar and word structure is key. Franz Och, Google’s MT team leader, provides with a glimpse into the future arguing that this technology “will allow anyone to communicate with anyone else”. His promise is supported by Nicholas Ostler in his book The Last Lingua Franca where he argues that Google will eventually liberate the world from the necessity of learning dominant languages such as English, and will reinforce linguistic diversity. For the future of language learning the focus perhaps will be in the acquisition of the fastgrowing languages of the Internet. Formal language learning will continue to be on demand and so will be the need to get communicated and/or understood in various languages by means of mobile apps for language practice and interpreting. Initiatives such as multilingual crowd sourcing will continue growing to aid language learning and also in combination to machine translation to ensure high quality translations for various purposes. This paper explores the connections between free online Machine Translation, mobile learning via a wide array of easily accessible apps, and the future of language learning as we know it. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","2016","2021-02-07 01:28:11","2021-02-07 01:28:11","","1-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, human labeling is very costly. To tackle this training data bottleneck, we develop a dual-learning mechanism, which can enable an NMT system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game. This mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine translation task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal) versus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form a closed loop, and generate informative feedback signals to train the translation models, even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the dual-learning mechanism, we use one agent to represent the model for the primal task and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task, then ask them to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the feedback signals generated during this process (e.g., the language-model likelihood of the output of a model, and the reconstruction error of the original sentence after the primal and dual translations), we can iteratively update the two models until convergence (e.g., using the policy gradient methods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation dual-NMT. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on English - French translation; especially, by learning from monolingual data (with 10% bilingual data for warm start), it achieves a comparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the French-to-English translation task. © 2016 NIPS Foundation - All Rights Reserved.","2016","2021-02-07 01:28:13","2021-02-07 01:28:13","","820-828","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :262</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to control the computational complexity, NMT has to employ a small vocabulary, and massive rare words outside the vocabulary are all replaced with a single unk symbol. Besides the inability to translate rare words, this kind of simple approach leads to much increased ambiguity of the sentences since meaningless unks break the structure of sentences, and thus hurts the translation and reordering of the in-vocabulary words. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel substitution-translation-restoration method. In substitution step, the rare words in a testing sentence are replaced with similar in-vocabulary words based on a similarity model learnt from monolingual data. In translation and restoration steps, the sentence will be translated with a model trained on new bilingual data with rare words replaced, and finally the translations of the replaced words will be substituted by that of original ones. Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve more than 4 BLEU points over the attention-based NMT. When compared to the recently proposed method handling rare words in NMT, our method can also obtain an improvement by nearly 3 BLEU points.","2016","2021-02-07 01:28:19","2021-02-07 01:28:19","","2852-2858","","","2016-January","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :36</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It basically consists of enriching the phrase table of a PBSMT system with bilingual phrase pairs matching transfer rules and dictionary entries from a shallow-transfer RBMT system. This new strategy takes advantage of how the linguistic resources are used by the RBMT system to segment the source-language sentences to be translated, and overcomes the limitations of existing hybrid approaches that treat the RBMT systems as a black box. Experimental results confirm that our approach delivers translations of higher quality than existing ones, and that it is specially useful when the parallel corpus available for training the SMT system is small or when translating out-of-domain texts that are well covered by the RBMT dictionaries. A combination of this approach with a recently proposed unsupervised shallow-transfer rule inference algorithm results in a significantly greater translation quality than that of a baseline PBSMT; in this case, the only hand-crafted resource used are the dictionaries commonly used in RBMT.

Our model automatically extracts short-range and long-range reordering rules based on part-of-speech tags and alignment information. Our method, therefore, covers both local and global word order, and is more versatile than other methods. To obtain a better set of reordering rules, we omit generated rules if their weight is lower than a threshold α. The experimental results have shown that the translation quality has been improved significantly compared to the distance-based reordering model and comparable to the lexicalized model. Our approach is not only suitable for English-Vietnamese but also for language pairs which have many differences in syntax, such as English-Chinese and Chinese-Vietnamese. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","2015","2021-02-07 01:28:32","2021-02-07 01:28:32","","","","6","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","reordering rule; Statistical machine translation; word order","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges are quite clear when one compares the gradually emerging Arabic to English Machine Translation with the rapidly developing Machine Translations available today. The lagging of the former may be attributed to two reasons. The first is the impenetrability of some Arabic words, which puzzles their decomposition into morphemes. The second is the incompatibility of existing machine-translation techniques with the Arabic language. The degree of difficulty can easily be observed by checking the results of any artless round-trip machine translation of arbitrary Arabic texts. Even the most advanced technologies that are available today are challenged. Regardless of whether the round trip is Arabicto- English-to-Arabic or English-to-Arabic-to-English, the inevitable outcome will be disenchanting. This leads to an even more disappointing conclusion. That is, as long as no drastic improvements are made, one must not take output of any machine translation of Arabic as orthodox. Yet another disappointing fact is that most of the intelligent machines are built to produce woodenly literal or paraphrased translations. This paper proposes a framework for a biphasic Arabic translation process.

There are certain common errors that occur during writing such as missing letters, extra letters, disordered letters, and misspelled letters. These kind of common spelling errors are called phonetics spelling errors. These are of a major concern while dealing with phonetics. Out of various problems that the phoneticians are trying to solve, major portion of it concentrates on varieties of spelling errors. Phonetic structures are greatly emphasized based on the effectiveness, appropriateness and accuracy. In order to keep abreast with the changing and challenging trends of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is of great importance that one should resolve the problems of spelling errors. To achieve the goal, numerous realistic and practical approaches have to be adopted that make use of spelling correction algorithms such as Edit distance, Habit distance, Soundex and Asoundex. Through the analysis of these algorithms, a new interface is put forward that calculates the Edit distance, thereby showing the overall comparative study of phonetic algorithms with the proposed modified Edit Distance algorithm. The interface computes the Edit distance between two strings in appropriate and intuitive way, contemplating with the comparisons shown in the distance table. The Results show that an average of 0.937 recall and 0.947 precision have been achieved with the F-measure 0.9417. Through these results, it is evident that the recall and F-measures are improved in the proposed Edit-Distance algorithm. The revised version of the edit distance algorithm consistently attains finer quality results in comparison with the traditional edit distance algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.","2015","2021-02-07 01:28:44","2021-02-07 01:28:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Ambiguity; Edit distance; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Phonetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics, ICCCI 2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MT is used as a black box to align source and target sub-segments on the fly in the translation units (TUs) suggested to the user. Source-language (SL) and target-language (TL) segments in the matching TUs are segmented into overlapping sub-segments of variable length and machine-translated into the TL and the SL, respectively. The bilingual subsegments obtained and the matching between the SL segment in the TU and the segment to be translated are employed to build the features that are then used by a binary classifier to determine the target words to be changed and those to be kept unedited. In this approach, MT results are never presented to the translator. Two approaches are presented in this work: one using a word-keeping recommendation system which can be trained on the TM used with the CAT system, and a more basic approach which does not require any training. Experiments are conducted by simulating the translation of texts in several language pairs with corpora belonging to different domains and using three different MT systems. We compare the performance obtained to that of previous works that have used statistical word alignment for word-keeping recommendation, and show that the MT-based approaches presented in this paper are more accurate in most scenarios. In particular, our results confirm that the MT-based approaches are better than the alignment-based approach when using models trained on out-of-domain TMs. Additional experiments were also performed to check how dependent the MT-based recommender is on the language pair and MT system used for training. These experiments confirm a high degree of reusability of the recommendation models across various MT systems, but a low level of reusability across language pairs. ©2015 AI Access Foundation.

Although some word reordering methods do not employ source-language syntactic structures, such structures are inherently useful for word reordering. However, high-quality syntactic parsers are not available for many languages. We propose a preordering method using a target-language syntactic parser to process source-language syntactic structures without a source-language syntactic parser. To train our preordering model based on ITG, we produced syntactic constituent structures for source-language training sentences by (1) parsing target-language training sentences, (2) projecting constituent structures of the target-language sentences to the corresponding source-language sentences, (3) selecting parallel sentences with highly synchronized parallel structures, (4) producing probabilistic models for parsing using the projected partial structures and the Pitman-Yor process, and (5) parsing to produce full binary syntactic structures maximally synchronized with the corresponding target-language syntactic structures, using the constraints of the projected partial structures and the probabilistic models. Our ITG-based preordering model is trained using the produced binary syntactic structures and word alignments. The proposed method facilitates the learning of ITG by producing highly synchronized parallel syntactic structures based on crosslanguage syntactic projection and sentence selection. The preordering model jointly parses input sentences and identifies their reordered structures. Experiments with Japanese-English and Chinese-English patent translation indicate that our method outperforms existing methods, including string-to-tree syntax-based SMT, a preordering method that does not require a parser, and a preordering method that uses a sourcelanguage dependency parser.","2015","2021-02-07 01:28:47","2021-02-07 01:28:47","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Constituent structure; Inversion transduction grammar; Preordering; Syntactic projection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe a hybrid translation approach coupling an Arabic-French statistical machine translation system using the Moses decoder with additional morphological rules that reduce the morphology of the source language (Arabic) to a level that makes it closer to that of the target language (French). Moreover, we introduce additional swapping rules for a structural matching between the source language and the target language. Two structural changes involving the positions of the pronouns and verbs in both the source and target languages have been attempted. The results show an improvement in the quality of translation and a gain in terms of BLEU score after introducing a pre-processing scheme for Arabic and applying these rules based on morphological variations and verb re-ordering (VS into SV constructions) in the source language (Arabic) according to their positions in the target language (French). Furthermore, a learning curve shows the improvement in terms on BLEU score under scarce- and large-resources conditions.

This complementarity has, over the last few years, resulted in the consolidation of a growing interest in hybrid systems that combine both data-driven and linguistic approaches. In this paper, we address the situation in which the amount of bilingual resources that is available for a particular language pair is not sufficiently large to train a competitive statistical MT system, but the cost and slow development cycles of rule-based MT systems cannot be afforded either. In this context, we formalise a new method that uses scarce parallel corpora to automatically infer a set of shallow-transfer rules to be integrated into a rule-based MT system, thus avoiding the need for human experts to handcraft these rules. Our work is based on the alignment template approach to phrase-based statistical MT, but the definition of the alignment template is extended to encompass different generalisation levels. It is also greatly inspired by the work of Sánchez-Martínez and Forcada (2009) in which alignment templates were also considered for shallow-transfer rule inference. However, our approach overcomes many relevant limitations of that work, principally those related to the inability to find the correct generalisation level for the alignment templates, and to select the subset of alignment templates that ensures an adequate segmentation of the input sentences by the rules eventually obtained. Unlike previous approaches in literature, our formalism does not require linguistic knowledge about the languages involved in the translation. Moreover, it is the first time that conflicts between rules are resolved by choosing the most appropriate ones according to a global minimisation function rather than proceeding in a pairwise greedy fashion. Experiments conducted using five different language pairs with the free/open-source rule-based MT platform Apertium show that translation quality significantly improves when compared to the method proposed by Sánchez-Martínez and Forcada (2009), and is close to that obtained using handcrafted rules. For some language pairs, our approach is even able to outperform them. Moreover, the resulting number of rules is considerably smaller, which eases human revision and maintenance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2015","2021-02-07 01:28:56","2021-02-07 01:28:56","","46-90","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Hybrid machine translation; Machine translation; Transfer rule inference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental results showed that the topdown method is more than 10 times faster than a method using the CYK algorithm. A phrase-based machine translation system with the top-down method had statistically significantly higher BLEU scores for 7 language pairs without relying on supervised syntactic parsers, compared to baseline systems using existing preordering methods. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2015","2021-02-07 01:29:25","2021-02-07 01:29:25","","208-218","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :13</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACL-IJCNLP 2015 - 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The linear combination assumes that all the features are in a linear relationship and constrains that each feature interacts with the rest features in an linear manner, which might limit the expressive power of the model and lead to a under-fit model on the current data. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear modeling for the quality of translation hypotheses based on neural networks, which allows more complex interaction between features. A learning framework is presented for training the non-linear models. We also discuss possible heuristics in designing the network structure which may improve the non-linear learning performance. Experimental results show that with the basic features of a hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system, our method produce translations that are better than a linear model. © 2015 Association for Computationl Linguisticss.","2015","2021-02-07 01:29:50","2021-02-07 01:29:50","","825-835","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACL-IJCNLP 2015 - 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT'14 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT'14 contest task. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2015","2021-02-07 01:29:51","2021-02-07 01:29:51","","11-19","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :215</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACL-IJCNLP 2015 - 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, three basic operations are needed for Korean morphological analysis: morpheme restoration, morpheme segmentation, and morpheme tagging. A variety of methods have been developed using the combinations of these three basic operations. In this paper, we define three syllable-based probabilistic models for Korean morphological analysis, and compare the models by implementing them with a cascading statistical machine translation (SMT) tool and a conditional random fields (CRFs) tool. The lexical forms of morphemes are restored by an SMT model, the morpheme sequences are segmented into each unit, and the part-of-speech tags are attached to each unit by CRFs models. For the integration, we used the beam search method, which involved rescaling the output ranks and probabilities originated by the different tools.

Even when dealing with closely-related language pairs, statistical machine translation encounters problems if the parallel corpus is not big enough. To reduce the problem of data sparsity, we use the approach called factored translation, which has proven successful when translating between English and a morphologically rich language. We show that it is even more useful when translating between two highly inflected languages. The main contribution of the paper involves two extensions of the factored translation approach. First, we propose a new, more general asynchronous framework for training translation components, where lemmas in the lemma component and MSD tags in the MSD component are aligned independently of alignment done for surface word forms. The second contribution of the paper is a new technique for efficient use of a bilingual dictionary in the translation process. A dictionary is introduced into the lemma component to improve lexical translation. Dictionary use is based on entropy. We tested our enhanced translation approach on the Slovenian-Serbian language pair. The system was trained on a freely available OpenSubtitle corpus. The results show improvements in automatic scores (BLEU and TER). The approach could be used for other language pairs, especially if one or both are highly inflected.","2014","2021-02-07 01:30:15","2021-02-07 01:30:15","","96-103","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Bilingual dictionary; Entropy; Highly inflected languages; Phrase-based translation; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine translation is increasingly used to support multilingual communication. In the traditional, transparent-channel way of using machine translation for the multilingual communication, translation errors are ignorable, due to the quality limitation of current machine translators. Those translation errors will break the communication and lead to miscommunication. We propose to shift the paradigm from the transparent-channel metaphor to the human-interpreter metaphor, which motives the interactions between the users and the machine translator. Following this paradigm shifting, the interpreter (agent) encourages the dialog participants to collaborate, as their interactivity will be helpful in reducing the number of translation errors, the noise of the channel. We examine the translation issues raised by multilingual communication, and analyze the impact of interactivity on the elimination of translation errors. We propose an implementation of the agent metaphor, which promotes interactivity between dialog participants and the machine translator. We design the architecture of our agent, analyze the interaction process, describe decision support and autonomous behavior, and provide an example of preparing repair strategy.

Despite this, there are many scenarios, as in the correction of the errors of fully-automatic systems using HTR in a post-editing step, in which the information from the specific task allows to constrain the search and therefore to improve the HTR accuracy. For example, in machine translation (MT), the on-line HTR system can also be used to correct translation errors. The HTR can take advantage of information from the translation problem such as the source sentence that is translated, the portion of the translated sentence that has been supervised by the human, or the translation error to be amended. Empirical experimentation suggests that this is a valuable information to improve the robustness of the on-line HTR system achieving remarkable results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (subsequent position; SP) given the last translated source word position (current position; CP). We propose a distortion model that can simultaneously consider the word at the CP, the word at an SP candidate, the context of the CP and an SP candidate, relative word order among the SP candidates, and the words between the CP and an SP candidate. These considered elements are called rich context. Our model considers rich context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to each SP candidate. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among SP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In contrast to the learning strategy of existing methods, our learning strategy is that the model learns preference relations among SP candidates in each sentence of the training data. This leaning strategy enables consideration of all of the rich context simultaneously. In our experiments, our model had higher BLUE and RIBES scores for Japanese-English, Chinese-English, and German-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models. © 2014 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).","2014","2021-02-07 01:30:23","2021-02-07 01:30:23","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Distortion model; Machine translation; Reordering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Native German speakers find it difficult to understand how Chinese sentences convey meanings without using cases. Statistical machine translation tools may deliver correct German-Chinese translations, but would not explain educational matters. This article reviews some interdisciplinary research on bilingualism, and expounds on how translation is carried out through cross-linguistic cue switching processes. Machine translation approaches are revisited from the perspective of cue switching concluding that: the word order cue is explicitly simulated in all machine translation approaches, and the case cue being implicitly simulated in statistical machine translation approaches can be explicitly simulated in rule-based and example-based machine translation approaches. A convergent result of machine translation research is to advocate an explicit deep-linguistic representation. Here, a novel machine translation method is motivated by blending existing machine translation methods from the viewpoint of cue-switching, and is firstly aimed as an educational tool. This approach takes a limited amount of German-Chinese translations in textbooks as examples, whose cues can be manually obtained, and for which we have developed MultiNet-like deep linguistic representations and cross-linguistic cue-switching processes. Based on this corpus, our present tool is aimed at helping native German speakers to learn Chinese more efficiently, and shall later be expanded to a more comprehensive machine translation system. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2014","2021-02-07 01:30:27","2021-02-07 01:30:27","","","343","","8404 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: PART 2 Pages: 354 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-54903-8_29","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance.

However, this technique is dependent upon the availability of applicable parallel corpora. Historically, such corpora have been quite limited in size and scope. In this paper, we provide new results regarding implementation of cross-lingual LSI text processing systems employing parallel corpora produced using modern machine translation (MT) products. We present measurements using the Reuters 21578 test set to demonstrate three key points regarding this combined LSI/modern MT approach: (1) for some languages, this approach can create parallel corpora of sufficient fidelity to support effective multilingual and cross-lingual LSI applications, (2) the technique is not particularly sensitive to details of LSI parameters, and (3) multiple languages can be represented in a single LSI space with little degradation in performance. © 2014 IEEE.","2014","2021-02-07 01:31:13","2021-02-07 01:31:13","","65-72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Cross-lingual; Latent semantic indexing; Machine translation; Multilingual; Parallel corpora","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ITNG 2014 - Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a new statistical method, based on a comparison between machine translations and reference sentences, which will be utilized as a direct method for measuring word order. This method reflects the organization of machine translation sentences. We will show that our statistical method associates very well with human judgments and that this method has numerous beneficial properties i.e., it gives a fitting of a dataset; in that it instructsdirect this data successively (without losing generality). Furthermore, this method calculates values founded by all texts.

Based on this analysis, we identify the transfer bilingual rules form source language to target language so that the translation of source language to target language can be performed by computers successfully. Then, we build and implement a machine translation prototype called AMTS to translate from Arabic to Malay based on rule based approach. The system is evaluated on set of simple Arabic sentences. The techniques used to evaluate the correctness of the system translation are the BLEU metric algorithm and the human judgment.

To solve this problem, several attempts have been initiated, each having the objective to obtain a better translation quality of the parallel corpora. But before the various ambiguities of the natural language, the problem of translation is far from easy to solve. To do this, and in order to increase the translation quality, we propose a model for the generation of different semantic cases relating to different components of the sentence to determine the meaning first and then generate the translation into the language target. This allowed us to obtain satisfactory results compared to similar studies using other techniques. In our approach, we used a model guided by the semantics to learn the techniques of translation with a similar human performance. Our project is to translate source sentences from Arabic to French through a statistical approach that includes a dictionary and that is automatically evaluated by the BLEU metric to ensure encouraging results even if the tools that we use are very limited. © 2014 IEEE.","2014","2021-02-07 01:31:44","2021-02-07 01:31:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","alignment; parallel corpora; statistcal machine translation; statistical approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014 World Congress on Computer Applications and Information Systems, WCCAIS 2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is not only because of language specific phraseology, but is rather a consequence of the peculiar way each natural language categorizes events i.e. it is a consequence of semantic factors. In ordinary languages the most frequent Action verbs are ""general"", since they extend productively to actions belonging to different ontological types. Moreover, each language categorizes action in its own way and therefore the cross-linguistic reference to everyday activities is puzzling. But the actual variation of verbs across action types is largely unknown.

In our proposed method, we extract lexical co-occurrence relationships of a given reference translation (Ref) and its corresponding hypothesis sentence using hyperspace analogue to language space matrix. Then, for each term appearing in these two sentences, we convert the co-occurrence information into a conditional probability distribution. Finally, by comparing the conditional probability distributions of the words held in common by Ref and the candidate sentence (Cand) using Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can score the hypothesis. ELEXR can evaluate MT by using only one Ref assigned to each Cand without incorporating any semantic annotated resources like WordNet. Our experiments on eight language pairs of WMT 2011 submissions show that ELEXR outperforms baselines, TER and BLEU, on average at system-level correlation with human judgments. It achieves average Spearman's rho correlation of about 0.78, Kendall's tau correlation of about 0.66 and Pearson's correlation of about 0.84, corresponding to improvements of about 0.04, 0.07 and 0.06 respectively over BLEU, the best baseline. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","2013","2021-02-07 01:32:10","2021-02-07 01:32:10","","","394","","8265 LNAI","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: PART 1 Pages: 405 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-45114-0_32","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Automatic evaluation; BLEU; Evaluation metrics; Lexical relationships; Machine translation; Machine translation evaluation; TER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a topic-based coherence model to produce coherence for document translation, in terms of the continuity of sentence topics in a text. We automatically extract a coherence chain for each source text to be translated. Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. The proposed topic-based coherence model then uses the predicted target coherence chain to help decoder select coherent word/phrase translations. Our experiments show that incorporating the topic-based coherence model into machine translation achieves substantial improvement over both the baseline and previous methods that integrate document topics rather than coherence chains into machine translation.

In this system ranking scenario, post-editing poses some important challenges: i) multiple post-editors are required since having the same annotator fixing alternative translations of a given input segment can bias their post-editing; ii) achieving high enough inter-annotator agreement requires extensive training, which is not always feasible; iii) there exists a natural variation among post-editors, particularly w.r.t. editing time and keystrokes, which makes their measurements less directly comparable.

The result should be as close to a human reference translation as possible, but varying word order or synonyms have to be taken into account for the evaluation of the similarity of both. In the conventional methods, researchers tend to employ many resources such as the synonyms vocabulary, paraphrasing, and text entailment data, etc. To make the evaluation model both accurate and concise, this paper explores the evaluation only using Part-of-Speech information of the words, which means the method is based only on the consilience of the POS strings of the hypothesis translation and reference. In this developed method, the POS also acts as the similar function with the synonyms in addition to its syntactic or morphological behaviour of the lexical item in question. Measures for the similarity between machine translation and human reference are dependent on the language pair since the word order or the number of synonyms may vary, for instance. This new measure solves this problem to a certain extent by introducing weights to different sources of information.

Since the Chinese characters in Japanese originated from ancient China, many common Chinese characters exist between these two languages. Since Chinese characters contain significant semantic information and common Chinese characters share the same meaning in the two languages, they can be quite useful in Chinese-Japanese machine translation (MT). We therefore propose a method for creating a Chinese character mapping table for Japanese, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, with the aim of constructing a complete resource of common Chinese characters. Furthermore, we point out two main problems in Chinese word segmentation for Chinese-Japanese MT, namely, unknown words and word segmentation granularity, and propose an approach exploiting common Chinese characters to solve these problems. We also propose a statistical method for detecting other semantically equivalent Chinese characters other than the common ones and a method for exploiting shared Chinese characters in phrase alignment. Results of the experiments carried out on a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system and an example-based MT system show that our proposed approaches can improve MT performance significantly, thereby verifying the effectiveness of shared Chinese characters for Chinese-Japanese MT. © 2013 ACM.","2013","2021-02-07 01:32:40","2021-02-07 01:32:40","","","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :11</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Chinese characters; Chinese-Japanese; Machine translation; Phrase alignment; Segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rule based machine translation technique is used here, which involves the formation of rules which helps in re-ordering of the syntactic structures of the source language sentence along with its dependency information which bring that close to the structure of the target sentence. The parser identifies the syntactical elements in English sentences and suggests its Dravidian language translation taking into account various grammatical forms of those Dravidian languages. The usage of the parser in developing the syntactic structure plays a major role in the translation process. There are mainly two types of rules used here, one is transfer link rule and the other is morphological rules. In this method, the transfer link rules are used for generating target structure. Morphological rules are used for assigning morphological features. Context Free Grammars (CFG) is used in generation of the language structures.

As information is available in the Internet in different languages, it is impossible to retrieve the information in other languages. Universal Networking Language (UNL) addresses this issue by converting the requested information from other languages to UNL expressions followed by UNL expressions to respective native languages. Even though Bangla is the sixth most popular language in the world, there is no system developed so far to convert Bangla text into UNL expressions and vice versa. For this purpose, the authors develop a framework. The framework has two constituent parts: 1) EnConverter: converts Bangla native sentences into UNL expressions considering UNL compatible Bangla word dictionary and analysis rules, and 2) DeConverter: converts UNL expressions into respective Bangla sentences considering Bangla word dictionary and generations rules. In both cases, case structure analysis, Bangla parts of speech, and different forms of verbs along with their prefixes, suffixes, and inflections are taken into consideration. This chapter describes the complete theoretical analyses of the EnConversion and DeConversion frameworks. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework can successfully convert Bangla sentences into UNL expressions, and also can convert UNL expressions into corresponding Bangla sentences. © 2013 by IGI Global.

The idea is to use the annotated resources of one language (say, L1) for performing Sentiment Analysis in another language (say, L2) which does not have annotated resources. The success of such a scheme crucially depends on the availability of a MT system between L1 and L2. We argue that such a strategy ignores the fact that a Machine Translation system is much more demanding in terms of resources than a Sentiment Analysis engine. Moreover, these approaches fail to take into account the divergence in the expression of sentiments across languages. We provide strong experimental evidence to prove that even the best of such systems do not outperform a system trained using only a few polarity annotated documents in the target language. Having a very large number of documents in L1 also does not help because most Machine Learning approaches converge (or reach a plateau) after a certain training size (as demonstrated by our results). Based on our study, we take the stand that languages which have a genuine need for a Sentiment Analysis engine should focus on collecting a few polarity annotated documents in their language instead of relying on CLSA. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","2013","2021-02-07 01:32:57","2021-02-07 01:32:57","","","38","","7817 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: PART 2 Pages: 49 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-37256-8_4","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we present a language-independent approach based on a statistical machine translation framework to develop a proofreading tool, which detects grammatical errors as well as context-sensitive spelling mistakes (real-word errors). A hybrid model for grammar checking is suggested by combining the mentioned approach with an existing rule-based grammar checker. Experimental results on both English and Persian languages indicate that the proposed statistical method and the rule-based grammar checker are complementary in detecting and correcting syntactic errors. The results of the hybrid grammar checker, applied to some English texts, show an improvement of about 24% with respect to the recall metric with almost similar value for precision.

We focus on improving classification accuracy in a crosslingual setting where we have available labeled training instances about particular domain in different languages. We experiment with movie review and product review datasets consisting of polar texts in English and Turkish. The results of the study show that expanding training size with new instances taken from another corpus does not necessarily increase classification accuracy. And this happens primarily not due to (not always accurate) machine translation, but because of the inherent differences in corpora between two subsets written in different languages. Similarly, in case of co-training classification with machine translation we observe from the results that accuracy improvement can be explained by semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data coming from the same domain, but not due to cross-language co-training itself. Our results also show that amount of artificial noise added by machine translation services does not hinder classifiers much in polarity detection task. However, it is important to distinguish the effect of machine translation from the effect of merging different cross-lingual data sources and that like in case of transfer learning we may need to search for ways to account for cross-lingual data distribution differences.","2013","2021-02-07 01:33:35","2021-02-07 01:33:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :26</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine translation; Multi-lingual polarity detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Issues of Sentiment Discovery and Opinion Mining, WISDOM 2013 - Held in Conjunction with SIGKDD 2013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to traditional approaches that directly introduce syntactic constraints to translation rules by explicitly decorating them with syntactic annotations, which often exacerbate the data sparsity problem and cause other problems, our approach keeps translation rules intact and factorizes the use of syntactic constraints through two separate models: 1) a syntax mismatch model that associates each nonterminal of a translation rule with a distribution of tags that is used to measure the degree of syntactic compatibility of the translation rule on source spans; 2) a syntax-based reordering model that predicts whether a pair of sibling constituents in the constituent parse tree of the source sentence should be reordered or not when translated to the target language. The features produced by both models are used as soft constraints to guide the translation process.

Some recent work on multiview clustering provided positive answers to this question. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to address this problem using the constrained clustering framework. Unlike traditional Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints, the constraints generated from machine translation are dense yet noisy. We show how to incorporate this type of constraints by presenting two algorithms, one parametric and one non-parametric. Our algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and can consistently improve the clustering of real data, namely the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 Multilingual Dataset.

Experimental results on Chinese-to- English machine translation tasks show that our method is able to reduce almost the half size of the translation model with very tiny degradation of translation performance. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2012","2021-02-07 01:34:09","2021-02-07 01:34:09","","291-295","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2012 - Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show that the HPSG parser's PASs achieved the best dependency and translation accuracies. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2012","2021-02-07 01:34:40","2021-02-07 01:34:40","","100-104","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2012 - Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, nearly all the related research work focus on obtaining the translation of the unknown words in different ways. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to handle unknown words in statistical machine translation. Instead of trying great effort to find the translation of unknown words, this paper focuses on determining the semantic function the unknown words serve as in the test sentence and keeping the semantic function unchanged in the translation process. In this way, unknown words will help the phrase reordering and lexical selection of their surrounding words even though they still remain untranslated. In order to determine the semantic function of each unknown word, this paper employs the distributional semantic model and the bidirectional language model.

For each line of sentence a specific model specially trained for that line is used, as opposed to using a single model for all sentences. To enhance the coherence of sentences on every line, a coherence model using mutual information is applied to select candidates with better consistency with previous sentences.

Those numeral quantifiers often cause errors in Japanese-Chinese machine translation because of the wide variety of the Chinese classifiers and complicated correspondence between Japanese and Chinese classifiers. It depends on the quantified noun which classifier is appropriate. Accordingly, we devised a method for classifying the quantified nouns by their semantic attributes through comparative analysis of quantifiers in Chinese and Japanese sentences, and obtained translation rules for quantifiers that use the classification method.

By doing so, there are some tasks in which online adaptation is needed in order to adapt the system to changing scenarios. In the present work, we perform an exhaustive comparison of four online learning algorithms when combined with two adaptation strategies for the task of online adaptation in statistical machine translation. Two of these algorithms are already well-known in the pattern recognition community, such as the perceptron and passive-aggressive algorithms, but here they are thoroughly analyzed for their applicability in the statistical machine translation task. In addition, we also compare them with two novel methods, i.e., Bayesian predictive adaptation and discriminative ridge regression. In statistical machine translation, the most successful approach is based on a log-linear approximation to a posteriori distribution. According to experimental results, adapting the scaling factors of this log-linear combination of models using discriminative ridge regression or Bayesian predictive adaptation yields the best performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It has very important research merit. With the development of computer and information technology, digitization processing of OBI becomes an important aspect in current digitization processing of ancient Chinese font. For information researchers, the study object is OBI sentences added punctuation marks by experts, but it is also a heavy and difficult work processing these sentences. In order to reduce the burden of OBI experts and the research difficulties in the OBI information processing, reusing and managing the existing OBI knowledge, an example-based machine translation (EBMT) method is proposed. The advantages of EBMT for OBI are analyzed, and an example library building method based on OBI-Chinese parallel corpus is introduced. Firstly, the basic construction steps of bilingual parallel corpus are analyzed. Secondly, the processes and key technologies of EBMT for OBI are studied.

To this end, this paper reports a study and comparison of several specific Catalan-Spanish machine translation systems: two rule-based and two corpus-based (particularly, statisticalbased) systems, all of them freely available on the web. The translation quality analysis is performed under two different domains: journalistic and medical. The systems are evaluated by using standard automatic measures, as well as by native human evaluators. In addition to these traditional evaluation procedures, this paper reports a novel linguistic evaluation, which provides information about the errors encountered at the orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic levels. Results show that while rule-based systems provide a better performance at orthographic and morphological levels, statistical systems tend to commit less semantic errors. Furthermore, results show all the evaluations performed are characterised by some degree of correlation, and human evaluators tend to be specially critical with semantic and syntactic errors.","2012","2021-02-07 01:35:37","2021-02-07 01:35:37","","245-270","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :25</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Catalan; Rule-based machine translation; Spanish; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The translation of scientific text is still limited in accuracy due to the fact that the scientific terms cannot be translated appropriately. Word order rules are very important for the generation of sentences in the target language whereas the word order in Arabic language is different from the order in English. Any Arabic Machine Translation (MT) system to English should be able to deal with word order. Approach: The aim of this study is to introduces-MT (Verbal Sentence rule based Machine Translation), an automatic system for Arabic verbal sentence of scientific text to English translation using transfer based approach. Verbal sentences constitute the majority of Arabic scientific document. The system involves three phases: analysis, transfer and generation phase. The transfer method is one of the rule based approach category and the most common technique used in machine translation system. Results: The system was trained on 45 verbal sentences from different Arabic scientific text and tested on 30 new verbal sentences from different domain. An experiment performed involves comparison with two other machine translation systems namely Syzran and Google. The accuracy of the result of the designed system is 93%. Conclusion: VS-MT has been successfully implemented and tested on many verbal sentences from different field of Arabic thesis. An experiment was performed which involves comparison with two other machine translation systems namely Syzran and Google.

One important type of contextual information concerns who or what a coreferring pronoun corefers to (i.e., its antecedent). Languages differ significantly in how they achieve coreference, and awareness of antecedents is important in choosing the correct pronoun. Disregarding a pronoun's antecedent in translation can lead to inappropriate coreferring forms in the target text, seriously degrading a reader's ability to understand it. This work assesses the extent to which source-language annotation of coreferring pronouns can improve English-Czech Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).

We propose two ways to achieve the adaptation effect and both of them are aimed at tuning parameter weights on a set of parallel queries. The first approach is via a standard tuning procedure optimizing for BLEU score and the second one is via a reranking approach optimizing for MAP score. We also extend the second approach by using syntax-based features. Our experiments show improvements of 1-2.5 in terms of MAP score over the retrieval with the non-Adapted translation. We show that these improvements are due both to the integration of the adaptation and syntax-features for the query translation task. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2012","2021-02-07 01:36:20","2021-02-07 01:36:20","","109-119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :24</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EACL 2012 - 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many situations, text to be translated constitutes an unbounded stream of data that grows continually with time. An effective approach to translate text documents is to follow an interactive-predictive paradigm in which both the system is guided by the user and the user is assisted by the system to generate error-free translations. Unfortunately, when processing such unbounded data streams even this approach requires an overwhelming amount of manpower. Is in this scenario where the use of active learning techniques is compelling. In this work, we propose different active learning techniques for interactive machine translation.

The algorithm based on morphological rules related to Sana'ani dialect as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Such rules facilitate the dialect conversion to its corresponding MSA. The algorithm tokenizes the input dialect text and analyses each token into stem and its affixes; such affixes can be categorized into two categories: dialect affixes and/or MSA affixes. At the same time, the stem could be dialect stem or MSA stem. Therefore, our algorithm must pay attention to such situations. That is done by using of a simple MSA stemmer. Then our dialect stemmer is applied to strip the resulting token and extract dialect affixes. At this point, the rules take place to decide when to carry out the extraction of an affix. The experiment shows that Sana'ani dialect has three classes of distortions. They are prefixes, suffixes, and stems distortions. The algorithm normalizes such distortion based on the morphological rules. For each morphological rule the algorithm checks possibility of applying such rule. That means if rule conditions meet, then the dialect affix will be replaced by its MSA correspondence. If there is no restriction on applying the rule related to the distorted stem, then the rule can be considered as a parallel corpus of dialect and MSA. Finally, the experiment computes the distortion ratio of MSA in Sana'ani dialect. For Sana'ani dialect sample of 529 words, 6.98% of them have distorted suffixes, 5.65% have distorted prefixes and 11.72% contain distorted stems. These percentages are related to processed words only.","2011","2021-02-07 01:36:44","2021-02-07 01:36:44","","892-895","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Modern standard Arabic; MSA; NLP; Rule-based machine translation; Sana'a dialect; Yemeni","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-the-art machine translation system over its BLEU-tuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better human-judged translation quality than the BLEU-tuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license.

In this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. Since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. In this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. In particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. Evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.81 in BLUE score over Moses.

Most work has used a parser in the source language along with rules to map the source language word order into the target language word order. The requirement to have a source language parser is a major drawback, which we seek to overcome in this paper. Instead of using a parser and then using rules to order the source side sentence we learn a model that can directly reorder source side sentences to match target word order using a small parallel corpus with high-quality word alignments. Our model learns pairwise costs of a word immediately preceding another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to find the best source reordering efficiently during training and testing and show that it suffices to provide good quality reordering. We show gains in translation performance based on our reordering model for translating from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For English to Hindi we show that our technique achieves better performance than a method that uses rules applied to the source side English parse. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2011","2021-02-07 01:37:19","2021-02-07 01:37:19","","486-496","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :26</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMNLP 2011 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state-of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrase-based model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-the-art translation models. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.","2011","2021-02-07 01:37:23","2021-02-07 01:37:23","","216-226","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :30</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMNLP 2011 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present an unsupervised discriminative training framework to incorporate the usually plentiful target-language monolingual data by using a rough ""reverse"" translation system. Intuitively, our method strives to ensure that probabilistic ""round-trip"" translation from a target-language sentence to the source-language and back will have low expected loss. Theoretically, this may be justified as (discriminatively) minimizing an imputed empirical risk.

In this study, we introduce an improved ranking mechanism that dynamically learns from user feedback.

Also, source sentences often include non-word elements, such as parentheses, quotation marks, and list markers. In order to resolve the differences efficiently and make source sentences appropriate to translation system by arranging them, we propose pre-processing for source sentences.

These template-based approaches (G-EBMT) find common patterns in the bilingual corpus to generate generalized templates. In the past, patterns in the corpus were found by only few of the following ways: finding similar or dissimilar portions of text in groups of sentence-pairs, finding semantically similar words, or use dictionaries and parsers to find syntactic correspondences. This paper combines all the three aspects for generating templates. In this paper, the boundaries for aligning and extracting members (phrase-pairs) for clustering are found using chunkers (hence, syntactic information) trained independently on the two languages under consideration. Then semantically related phrase-pairs are grouped based on the contexts in which they appear. Templates are then constructed by replacing these clustered phrase-pairs by their class labels. We also perform a filtration step by simulating human labelers to obtain only those phrase-pairs that have high correspondences between the source and the target phrases that make up the phrase-pairs.

The translation is a creative process which involves interpretation of the text that given by the translator. In addition, the translation depends on the purpose for which it meant according to context, as well as the text context includes different size and types of sentences. In addition, English words order in target language is not the same order as the Arabic source language, so the translation from English to Arabic definitely needs effort to synchronize words between English and Arabic that based on matching rules grammar between both languages. Approach: This study focuses on the existing Context Free Grammar (CFG) format as well as identifying the Part Of Speech (POS) for single words and reordering the CFG for reorder purpose of English structure to Arabic structure and validate the reorder CFG constructed by the algorithm. Reordering algorithm is a system for translating structured English sentence in text to structure Arabic sentence in text that runs compatibly with English/Arabic interface.

Consequently, to support natural referring behaviour in machine translation mediated communication between pairs, our study suggests the importance of resolving the asymmetries and inconsistencies caused by machine translations. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground among triads, it is important for addressees to be able to monitor what is going on between a speaker and other addressees.

The user of the system, however, is unable to judge the quality of the translation. This problem can be solved by providing the user with a percentage score for each translated sentence. The idea to base transfer score computation on the similarity between the input sentence and the example is not sufficient. Real-life examples show that the transfer process is as likely to go well with a bad translation memory example as to fail with a good example.

In such systems, the human translator translates the text while the machine provides completion to it. The user is given options to accept either the entire or a part of the suggested completion. Moreover, the user is also permitted to skip the suggestions and continue typing. Thereafter, we focus on TransType2 project, its architecture, and its evaluation methods. Furthermore we analyze the user log files of the last TransType2 Evaluation round. Eventually, according to the obtained analysis results, TransType2 project deliverables, and reports of human translators, we recommend several new features and adjustments to the current evaluation methodology of interactive-predictive machine translation systems. These new methods take advantage of the existing systems, add evaluation methods to them and modify them to result in qualified systems. © 2010 IEEE.","2010","2021-02-07 01:38:30","2021-02-07 01:38:30","","568-573","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Computer-assisted translation; Interactive-predictive machine translation; Machine translation evaluation; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we deal with the root word of Bangla sentence. We show here how to use the root word to translate the Bangla sentence into English Sentence. We deal here first to find out the root word from the database. Here is also an alternative to use the morphological analyzing. After that we define the parts of speech of that sentence. Then we detect the proper grammatical structure of that sentence. Then we find the grammar for the targeted language.

We present a novel, discriminative sample selection strategy that preferentially selects batches of candidate sentences with constructs that lead to erroneous translations on a held-out development set. The proposed strategy supports a built-in diversity mechanism that reduces redundancy in the selected batches.

Collaborative machine translation systems do not only translate the input sentence into a target language but also back-translate the translation into the input language in a reverse way, and the user can repair the input sentence to improve the quality of translation referring to the back translation. However, it is not easy for novice users to repair the input sentence appropriately to be translated correctly. We propose a guided input method that assists the users to compose input sentences by presenting word candidates that may lead to a correct translation. The word candidates are generated from the sentence structure and word database that is created by storing input sentences that have been translated correctly. We evaluate the performance of the guided input method depending on the number of input sentences stored in the database. As the number of input sentences increases in the database, the performance of the method improves because the number of correct translations increases and the number of repairs decreases in an experiment of Japanese-Chinese translation. On the other hand, in an experiment of Japanese-English translation, the performance of the method is not so remarkable. The guided input method works better when the users are not familiar with the target language.","2010","2021-02-07 01:39:07","2021-02-07 01:39:07","","175-182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Back translation; Collaborative machine translation; Guided input method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 6th IASTED International Conference on Advances in Computer Science and Engineering, ACSE 2010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This poses a significant challenge to MT due to the vast number of ways to express the same sentence in Arabic. The ordering features are very important and should be carefully applied to ensure the generation of sentence in the target language. Because they apply to the target language, it should fulfill the specific requirement of this language. Mistakes in the MT output can be either the result of analysis problems at the source language level, or due to generation problem at target language level. Word order rules are crucial for the generation of sentences in the target language. They also serve as rules for the ordering of sentence constituents. These rules draw their information from the syntactic knowledge. The word order problem becomes more obvious when making machine translation between languages that have rich morphological variations. Approach: The main objective of this research is to develop a machine translation that translates Arabic noun phrases into English by using transfer-based approach. A system called Npae-Rbmt has been developed in this research. Transfer-based machine translation is one instance of rulebased machine-translation approaches and is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation. The idea of transfer-based machine translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the ""meaning"" of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation. Using advantages of transfer-based machine translation such as analysis step, the Transfer-based becomes simpler as linguistic analysis goes deeper-as the representation of analysis step becomes more abstract. In fact, a major goal of MT research is to define a level of analysis which is so deep in which transfer-based machine translation is able to do. Results: The method was tested on 88 thesis titles and journals from the computer science domain. The accuracy of the result was 94.6%. These results proved the viability of this approach for distant languages. Conclusion: Based on the achieved results, we have managed to perform the syntactic reordering within an Arabic noun phrases to English translation task by using transfer-based machine translation and also achieved reasonable improvements in translation quality over related approach. © 2010 Science Publications.","2010","2021-02-07 01:39:21","2021-02-07 01:39:21","","350-356","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :18</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Arabic language processing; Machine translation; Noun phrases; Npae-Rbmt; Transfer-based approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our contribution lies in an approach for domain-specific adaption of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT). The CLIR system is based on a multilingual domain ontology which is also used as a synchronization component between CLIR and MT. The MT system is adapted to the target domain using the terminology represented in the ontology and using statistical training performed on a collection of parallel texts. In the statistical training phase, new translations of a term can be discovered and used for ontology updating. The paper is organized as follows.

The characteristics of inflective languages are generally not taken into account by the statistical machine translation system. Existing translation systems often treat different inflected word forms of the same lemma as if they were independent of each other, although some interdependencies exist. On the other hand we know that if we reduce inflected word forms to common lemmas, some information is lost. It would be reasonable to eliminate only the variations in inflected word forms, which are not relevant for translation. Inflectional features of words are defined by morpho-syntactic descriptions (MSD) tags and we want reduce them. To do this the explicit knowledge about both languages (source and target language) is needed. The idea of the paper is to find the information-bearing MSDs in source language by data-driven approach. The task is performed by a global optimization algorithm, named Differential Evolution. The experiments were performed using freely available parallel English-Slovenian corpus SVEZ-IJS, which is lemmatized and annotated with MSD tags.

In the last few years, research in SMT has been characterized by two significant advances. First, the popularization of the so called phrase-based statistical translation models, which allows to incorporate local contextual information to the translation models. Second, the availability of larger and larger parallel corpora, which are composed of millions of sentence pairs, and tens of millions of running words. Since phrase-based models basically consists in statistical dictionaries of phrase pairs, their estimation from very large corpora is a very costly task that yields a huge number of parameters which are to be stored in memory. The handling of millions of model parameters and a similar number of training samples have become a bottleneck in the field of SMT, as well as in other well-known pattern recognition tasks such as speech recognition or handwritten recognition, just to name a few. In this paper, we propose a general framework that deals with the scaling problem in SMT without introducing significant time overhead by means of the combination of different scaling techniques. This new framework is based on the use of counts instead of probabilities, and on the concept of cache memory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To accomplish this, the training procedure determines for each feature function its exact error surface on a given set of candidate translations. The feature function weights are then adjusted by traversing the error surface combined over all sentences and picking those values for which the resulting error count reaches a minimum. Typically, candidates in MERT are represented as N-best lists which contain the N most probable translation hypotheses produced by a decoder. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that allows for efficiently constructing and representing the exact error surface of all translations that are encoded in a phrase lattice. Compared to N-best MERT, the number of candidate translations thus taken into account increases by several orders of magnitudes. The proposed method is used to train the feature function weights of a phrase-based statistical machine translation system.

The system combines multiple web based translation services, which allows for a low cost solution to the translation problem. By examining the translations of multiple systems, better translation can be done. The system uses heuristics to decide if the best translation should be chosen by picking a consensus translation or using statistical analysis.

Since the early 1960s, researchers have been building and utilizing computer systems that can translate from one language to another without requiring extensive human intervention. In the late 1990s, Ford Vehicle Operations began working with Systran Software Inc. to adapt and customize its machine-translation technology in order to translate Ford's vehicle assembly build instructions from English to German, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. The use of machine translation was made necessary by the vast amount of dynamic information that needed to be translated in a timely fashion. The assembly build instructions at Ford contain text written in a controlled language as well as unstructured remarks and comments. The MT system has already translated more than 7 million instructions into these languages and is an integral part of the overall manufacturing process-planning system used to support Ford's assembly plants in Europe, Mexico and South America. In this paper, we focus on how AI techniques, such as knowledge representation and natural language processing can improve the accuracy of machine translation in a dynamic environment such as auto manufacturing.

The model predicts block neighbors to carry out a phrase-based translation that explicitly handles local phrase reordering. We use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log-linear block bigram model which uses real-valued features (e.g., a language model score) as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves (e.g., block bigram features). The model training relies on an efficient enumeration of local block neighbors in parallel training data. A novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training algorithm is presented that can easily handle millions of features. Moreover, when viewing SMT as a block generation process, it becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging, phrase chunking, or shallow parsing. Our novel approach is successfully tested on a standard Arabic-English translation task using two different phrase reordering models: a block orientation model and a phrase-distortion model. © 2007 ACM.","2007","2021-02-07 01:40:40","2021-02-07 01:40:40","","","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine learning; Maximum entropy; Statistical machine translation; Stochastic gradient descent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even if more powerful, recursive models can be used to account for more complex mappings, it has been argued that the input-output relations underlying most usual natural language pairs can essentially be modeled by finite-state devices. Moreover, the relative simplicity of these mappings has recently led to the development of techniques for learning finite-state transducers from a training set of input-output sentence pairs of the languages considered. In the last years, these techniques have lead to the development of a number of machine translation systems. Under the statistical statement of machine translation, we overview here how modeling, learning and search problems can be solved by using stochastic finite-state transducers. We also review the results achieved by the systems we have developed under this paradigm. As a main conclusion of this review we argue that, as task complexity and training data scarcity increase, those systems which rely more on statistical techniques tend produce the best results. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007.","2007","2021-02-07 01:41:03","2021-02-07 01:41:03","","69-91","","1","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :14</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Grammatical inference; Machine translation; Stochastic finite-state transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, eight pairs from three different language communities - China, Korea, and Japan - worked on referential tasks in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using a machine translation embedded chat system. Drawing upon prior research, we predicted differences in conversational efficiency and content, and in the shortening of referring expressions over trials. Quantitative results combined with interview data show that lexical entrainment was disrupted in machine translation-mediated communication because echoing is disrupted by asymmetries in machine translations. In addition, the process of shortening referring expressions is also disrupted because the translations do not translate the same terms consistently throughout the conversation. To support natural referring behavior in machine translation-mediated communication, we need to resolve asymmetries and inconsistencies caused by machine translations. © Copyright 2006 ACM.","2006","2021-02-07 01:41:05","2021-02-07 01:41:05","","515-524","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :78</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Computer-mediated communication; Distributed work; Lexical entrainment; Machine translation; Multilingual groups; Reference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, CSCW","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the early 1960s, researchers have been building and utilizing computer systems that can translate from one language to another without extensive human intervention. In the late 1990s, Ford Vehicle Operations began working with Systran Software Inc to adapt and customize their Machine Translation (MT) technology in order to translate Ford's vehicle assembly build instructions from English to German, Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese. The use of Machine Translation (MT) was made necessary by the vast amount of dynamic information that needed to be translated in a timely fashion. Our MT system has already translated over 5 million instructions into these target languages and is an integral part of our manufacturing process planning to support Ford's assembly plants in Europe, Mexico and South America. In this paper, we focus on how AI techniques, such as knowledge representation (Iwanska & Shapiro 2000) and natural language processing (Gazdar & Mellish 1989), can improve the accuracy of Machine Translation in a dynamic environment such as auto manufacturing.

Next, statistical information is obtained based on the meaning of the nouns with an accompanying quantifier. Using the difference in type and position of quantifiers between Chinese and Japanese, quantifier translation rules were acquired. Evaluation was conducted by using the acquired translation rules.

This retrieval process is performed iteratively at increasing levels of detail, until the best match is detected.

In this work, we investigate and compare different strategies for the treatment of German compound words in statistical machine translation systems. For translation from German, we compare linguistic-based and corpusbased compound splitting. For translation into German, we investigate splitting and rejoining German compounds, as well as joining English potential components.

In particular, in statistical machine translation, heuristic search algorithms are employed whose level of approximation depends on the length of the input. Moreover, processing time can be a bottleneck with long sentences, whereas multiple text chunks can be quickly processed in parallel. Hence, in real working conditions the problem arises of how to optimally split the input text. In this work, we investigate several text segmentation criteria and verify their impact on translation performance by means of a statistical phrase-based translation system.

They connect typically a noun or a pronoun to another word and show their relationships in a sentence. They are a kind of ""small"" word and can not stand alone in the sentences. However, they often pose great problems in the identification of their relationships to other constituents. Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment is especially problematic in machine translation. Besides, as prepositions by themselves are semantically very ambiguous, the translation of these words poses challenge to machine translation (MT) too. This paper discusses how some of the PP attachments and other problems concerned with PPs are resolved in an experimental English-Chinese MT system by applying controlled language technique that we have developed in the context of safety-critical applications. Examples are extracted from a small parallel bilingual corpus focused on medical protocols in English and Chinese, where the usages, in particular some of the syntactic structures, vary a lot in many aspects. It is suggested that such ambiguities can be resolved by means of lexical information, such as subcategorizations, selection constraints and other additional information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","2006","2021-02-07 01:41:43","2021-02-07 01:41:43","","","593","","4139 LNAI","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 603 DOI: 10.1007/11816508_59","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Controlled language technique; Disambiguation; Equivalent; Grammatical functions; Machine translation (MT); Prepositional phrase attachment (PP attachment); Translation information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The alignment templates are converted into structural transfer rules that are used by a shallow-transfer machine translation engine to produce grammatically correct translations. As the experimental results show there is a considerable improvement in the translation quality as compared to word-for-word translation (when no transfer rules are used), and the translation quality is close to that achieved when hand-coded transfer rules are used.

An example of mismatches in English-to-Russian translation: a. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and tear-gassed by the police. b. Rus. Demonstranty podverglis' zverskomu izbieniju so storony policii; protiv nix byl primenën slezotočivyj gaz lit. 'Demonstrators underwent bestial beating from_side of_police; against them was applied tear-gas'. The only way to resolve inter-linguistic mismatches is paraphrasing - intra- or interlinguistic. To explain better what I mean I will refer to mismatches found in the example. Thus, in Russian: - The verb with the meaning '[to] tear-gas' does not exist, so you have to use the semantically equivalent expression '[to] apply tear-gas'. - The passive of the verb '[to] beat' - with the Actor 'police' - does not readily combine with the noun 'police' as the syntactic Agent (it is not official enough!), so you have to use the semantically equivalent expression '[to] undergo a beating' (with the Subject 'demonstrators'). - The expression '[to] apply tear-gas' does not have a passive and therefore cannot be directly conjoined with '[to] undergo a beating' (the two clauses have different Subjects), so you have to use loose coordination of two complete clauses. Such paraphrases are described by Deep-Syntactic Paraphrasing System of the Meaning-Text Theory: a few dozens universal paraphrasing rules (Mel'čuk 1992; Milićević 2006). Paraphrasing at the semantic and/or deep-syntactic level can be ensured only by an extremely rich dictionary. Thus, the transformation '[to] tear-gas' ⇒ '[to] apply tear-gas' is triggered by the information in the lexical entry of the Russian nominal expression SLEZOTOČIVYJ GAZ 'tear-gas' (where the semi-auxiliary verb PRIMENJAT' '[to] apply' is found). Such a dictionary, semantically-based and lexical co-occurrence centered, is the Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (Mel'čuk &amp; Žolkovskyj 1984, Mel'čuk et al. 1984-1999, Mel'čuk et al. 1995). Three major zones of its lexical entry for headword L present: - L's meaning, in the form of a formalized analytical lexicographic definition equivalent to a semantic network of the Meaning-Text Theory; - L's Government Pattern, which contains complete information about L's actants and their surface realization; - L's restricted lexical cooccurrence, in the form of Lexical Functions, which supply complete information about L's collocations (for instance: Real 1(slezotočivyj gaz 'tear-gas') = primenjat'[∼ protiv 'against' NY]; [AntiBon + Magn](izbivat' '[to] beat') = zverski lit.

However, these models are usually context-independent, therefore, the disambiguation of the translation of a source word must be carried out using other probabilistic distributions (distortion distributions and statistical language models). One efficient way to add contextual information to the statistical lexicons is based on maximum entropy modeling. In that framework, the context is introduced through feature functions that allow us to automatically learn context-dependent lexicon models. In a first approach, maximum entropy modeling is carried out after a process of learning standard statistical models (alignment and lexicon). In a second approach, the maximum entropy modeling is integrated in the expectation- maximization process of learning standard statistical models. Experimental results were obtained for two well-known tasks, the French-English Canadian Parliament Hansards task and the German-English Verbmobil task. These results proved that the use of maximum entropy models in both approaches, can help to improve the performance of the statistical translation systems.","2005","2021-02-07 01:42:05","2021-02-07 01:42:05","","135-158","","1-3","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Context-dependent lexicon models; Maximum entropy modeling; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, tagged corpora contain errors, which impedes the progress of research. Therefore, the correction of errors in corpora is an important research issue. In this study we investigate the correction of such errors, which we call corpus correction. Using machine-learning methods, we applied corpus correction to a verb modality corpus for machine translation. We used the maximum-entropy and decision-list methods as machine-learning methods. We compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments, and determined which is most effective by using a statistical test. We obtained several noteworthy findings: (1) Precision was almost the same for both detection and correction, so it is more convenient to do both correction and detection, rather than detection only. (2) In general, the maximum-entropy method worked better than the decision-list method; but the two methods had almost the same precision for the top 50 pieces of extracted data when closed data was used. (3) In terms of precision, the use of closed data was better than the use of open data; however, in terms of the total number of extracted errors, the use of open data was better than the use of closed data. Based on our analysis of these results, we developed a good method for corpus correction. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by carrying out experiments on machine translation. As corpus-based machine translation continues to be developed, the corpus correction we discuss in this article should prove to be increasingly significant. © 2005 ACM.","2005","2021-02-07 01:42:07","2021-02-07 01:42:07","","18-37","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :18</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Corpus correction; Machine learning; Machine translation; Modality corpus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two question-document language pair have been used: Spanish-English and Spanish- French. We used the GOOGLE Linguistic Tools at http://translate.google.com for the translation between first language pair, and SYSTRANSBox at http://w3.systranbox.com for the second. Our cross-language information retrieval system is a standard document retrieval system performing monolingual searches. Passages has been used rather complete documents, but the possibility of examining the context of a passage is intentionally excluded, although it reduces accuracy. For each question-document pair two groups of users were constituted depending if they have good or poor reading skills in document language. The use of on-line MT program for the translation of Spanish queries into document language obtains a high number of right answers for all groups, but better for Spanish-French pair groups, due to French is more closed language to Spanish than English, so the quality of the translations between Spanish and French is better. For our interactive CL-QA experiment, few corrections of translations were necessary in general, fewer for French target language. The use of MT to translate passages from English/French into Spanish in the displaying information process seems not improve the accuracy of the system. We expected that poor reading skills groups should obtain very much accuracy using this possibility, but difference is scarce when they don't use it. In general, all users reported that the possibility of translation the passages is highly appreciated. More experiment must be carried out to achieve other conclusions.","2005","2021-02-07 01:42:15","2021-02-07 01:42:15","","","","","1171","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particular attention is given to consideration of syntactic polysemy and ambiguity, and the mechanisms of polysemous structures presentation are proposed. The decisions are worked out on the basis of projecting the functional values through the traditional categorial meanings of language units and structures. The syntactic polysemy is understood as the immediate realization of more than one categorial head meaning within the same language structure. The phenomenon of syntactic polysemy determines the possible multiple transfer scheme for a given language pattern.

However, it is difficult to give complete linguistic knowledge to the system ex ante because natural language has various linguistic phenomena. Therefore, we worked to develop learning-based machine translation. In learning-based machine translation, a system acquires translation rules automatically from translation examples that are pairs of source and target language sentences. However, existing learning-based machine translation presents the problem that it requires a large number of similar translation examples. Consequently, it cannot acquire enough useful translation rules from sparse translation examples. This paper proposes a method of machine translation using Recursive Chain-Link-type Learning, which can acquire many useful translation rules from sparse translation examples. Our system, based on this method, efficiently acquires translation rules from each translation example without requiring two similar translation examples. Translation rules are acquired by extracting corresponding parts between source and target language sentences in translation examples. Our system determines those corresponding parts using previously acquired translation rules. Therefore, the system engenders a chain reaction in acquisition of new translation rules. Evaluation experiments using our system demonstrated an effective translation rate of 61.1%. Moreover, the effective translation rate was 85.0% when sufficient learning data were given to our system. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2004","2021-02-07 01:42:36","2021-02-07 01:42:36","","1-15","","2","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Chain-link; Learning; Machine translation; Recursive; Translation examples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes a new method for automatic extraction of bilingual collocations from a parallel text corpus using no linguistic knowledge. We use Recursive Chain-link-type Learning (RCL), which is a learning algorithm, to extract bilingual collocations. Our method offers two main advantages. One benefit is that this RCL system requires no linguistic knowledge. The other advantage is that it can extract many bilingual collocations, even if the frequency of appearance of the bilingual collocations is very low. Experimental results verify that our system extracts bilingual collocations efficiently.

Given a system consisting of two translation functions (one from language A to language B and one from B to A), training text is translated from A to B and back again to A. Using these two translations, differences in knowledge between the two translation functions are identified, and rules are learned to improve the functions. Context-independent rules are learned where the information suggests only a single possible translation for a word. When there are multiple alternate translations for a word, a likelihood ratio test is used to identify words that co-occur with each case significantly. These words are then used as context in context-dependent rules. Applied on the Pan American Health Organization corpus of 20,084 sentences, the learned rules improve the understandability of the translation produced by the SDL International engine on 78% of sentences, with high precision.","2003","2021-02-07 01:43:07","2021-02-07 01:43:07","","205-216","","","2837","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without the need of building an initial word-to-word alignment or initially segmenting the monolingual text into phrases as other methods do, this algorithm segments the sentences into phrases and finds their alignments simultaneously. For each sentence pair, ISA builds a two-dimensional matrix to represent a sentence pair where the value of each cell corresponds to the Point-wise Mutual Information (MI) between the source and target words. Based on the similarities of MI values among cells, we identify the aligned phrase pairs. Once all the phrase pairs are found, we know both how to segment one sentence into phrases and also the alignments between the source and target sentences. We use monolingual bigram language models to estimate the joint probabilities of the identified phrase pairs. The joint probabilities are then normalized to conditional probabilities, which are used by the decoder. Despite its simplicity, this approach yields phrase-to-phrase translations with significant higher precisions than our baseline system where phrase translations are extracted from the HMM word alignment. When we combine the phrase-to-phrase translations generated by this algorithm with the baseline system, the improvement on translation quality is even larger. © 2003 IEEE.","2003","2021-02-07 01:43:12","2021-02-07 01:43:12","","567-573","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :27</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Phrase alignment; Phrase segmentation; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NLP-KE 2003 - 2003 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The translation divergence problem is usually reserved for Transfer and Interlingual MT because it requires a large combination of complex lexical and structural mappings. A major requirement of these approaches is the accessibility of large amounts of explicit symmetric knowledge for both source and target languages. This limitation renders Transfer and Interlingual approaches ineffective in the face of structurally-divergent language pairs with asymmetric resources. GHMT addresses the more common form of this problem, source-poor/targetrich, by fully exploiting symbolic and statistical target-language resources. This non-interlingual non-transfer approach is accomplished by using target-language lexical semantics, categorial variations and subcategorization frames to overgenerate multiple lexico-structural variations from a target-glossed syntactic dependency of the source-language sentence. The symbolic overgeneration, which accounts for different possible translation divergences, is constrained by a statistical target-language model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.","2002","2021-02-07 01:43:33","2021-02-07 01:43:33","","","84","","2499","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 93 DOI: 10.1007/3-540-45820-4_9","<p>Cited By :10</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this model, recognition is a process of annotating image regions with words. Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well — for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.","2002","2021-02-07 01:43:42","2021-02-07 01:43:42","","","97","","2353","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 112 DOI: 10.1007/3-540-47979-1_7","<p>Cited By :957</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Correspondence; EM algorithm; Object recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However most existing machine translation systems reject utterances including irregular expressions. In order to improve the quality of translation and to make the machine translation systems easier to tune to the needs of different users, we propose a new Multi-Engine based Machine Translation approach. In the approach, several different types of translation engine as following are used in original language analysis and target language generation processing simultaneously. (I) Role based Translation Engine, (II) Example Based Translation Engine, (III) Family Modal based Translation Engine, and (IV) Super Function based Translation Engine. It is very difficult to select the best result when more than one translation engines are successful and the results are difference in traditional multi-engines method. To address the multi-selection problem, we propose a WMV (weighted maximum value) algorithm. The weight of each engine is decided by our experience and statistical information. A prototype system based on the proposed method is built and some experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper is effective for the implement of robust machine translation and the development of practical machine translation system.","2000","2021-02-07 01:43:57","2021-02-07 01:43:57","","402-406","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","Machine translation; Multi-Engine; Natural Language; Robust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The size and quality of the lexicon, as well as the coverage of the lexicon for a particular use, greatly influence the applicability of machine translation for a user. The high cost of lexicon development limits the extent to which even mature machine translation vendors can expand and specialize their lexicons, and frequently prevents users from building extensive lexicons at all. To address the high cost of lexicography for machine translation, L&H is building a Lexicography Toolkit that includes tools that can significantly improve the process of creating custom lexicons. The toolkit is based on the concept of using automatic methods of data acquisition, using text corpora, to generate lexicon entries. Of course, lexicon entries must be accurate, so the work of the toolkit must be checked by human experts at several stages. However, this checking mostly consists of removing erroneous results, rather than adding data and entire entries.

To resolve this problem, we propose a two-stage CLIR method. First, we translate a given query into the document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign documents. Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user language, and re-rank them based on the translation result. We also show the effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese queries and English technical documents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.","2000","2021-02-07 01:44:10","2021-02-07 01:44:10","","13-24","","","1934","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :8</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The number of not-translated words in a document is used as one measure in the evaluation of MT systems. Many MT developers agree that in order to reduce the number of NTWs in their systems, designers must increase the size or coverage of the lexicon to include these untranslated tokens, so that the system can handle them in future processing. While we accept this method for enhancing MT capabilities, in assessing the nature of NTWs in real-world documents, we found surprising results. Our study looked at the NTW output from two commercially available MT systems (Systran and Globalink) and found that lexical coverage played a relatively small role in the words marked as not translated. In fact, 45% of the tokens in the list failed to translate for reasons other than that they were valid source language words not included in the MT lexicon. For instance, e-mail addresses, words already in the target language and acronyms were marked as not-translated words. This paper presents our analysis of NTWs and uses these results to argue that in addition to lexicon enhancement, MT systems could benefit from more sophisticated pre- and postprocessing of real-world documents in order to weed out such NTWs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.","1998","2021-02-07 01:44:20","2021-02-07 01:44:20","","","356","","1529","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Pages: 363 DOI: 10.1007/3-540-49478-2_32","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, translation result of an automatic MT system is often not satisfactory for this purpose and requires post-editing. In addition, a purely rule-based system does not necessarily provide a satisfactory result for specific expressions because of lack of corresponding rules, nor purely example-based system for expressions not covered by examples. A hybrid approach is worthwhile to pursuit, where automatic and interactive approaches, as well as rule-oriented and data-oriented approaches are integrated. In this article, we propose a hybrid interactive machine translation method that combines rule-based, corpus-based and example-based approach with an interactive man-machine interface. We show that the previously proposed rule-based model can be naturally integrated with different translation paradigms. The interactive operations, previously introduced and shown to be useful for disambiguation in the rule-based transfer, are shown to be also useful to control covering by and selection of the matching examples, two major decisions in the example-based translation method. We also mention an online learning scheme of translation pairs from the user interaction.","1997","2021-02-07 01:44:39","2021-02-07 01:44:39","","977-982","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our MT method converts the source language into the target language by permuting translated words based on the unique relationships among individual words and hence has the advantage that it uses only morphemic information. To demonstrate our method, we present results from an experimental translation system constructed on a personal computer, in which 200 sentences extracted from IEICE Transactions are translated.

The knowledge utilized by these systems has been incorporated into a context‐based machine translation system (CONTRAST) developed by the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL). The Japanese language analysis component of the CONTRAST system consists of individual modules to analyze syntax, semantics and context. The syntactic analysis module is a completely parallel parsing system based on Earley's algorithm. The semantic analysis module conducts analysis based on case relations. The contextual analysis module creates an intermediate representation that correspond to original text. It does this by placing events included in the semantic analysis results for each individual sentence within a framework that is read out from the general knowledge described as a process model in the concept dictionary. The English text generation system of CONTRAST begins with this intermediate representation. Then, referring to the concept dictionary (common with the analysis module), it creates English text according to generation rules created from the real life text data dependent knowledge relating to English newspaper articles. The format of the concept dictionary, which consists of descriptions of general knowledge, and the format of the intermediate representation, which is a description of the contextual information contained in each body of text, are the same. The outline of the conceptual system employed and studies on the process of creating this system are also discussed.

One of the hypotheses being tested in the PANGLOSS machine translation project is whether or not these resources can be semi-automatically acquired on a very large scale. This paper focuses on the construction of a large ontology (or knowledge base, or world model) for supporting KBMT. It contains representations for some 70,000 commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods (e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another. Other methods (e.g., bilingual matching) allow a knowledge engineer to build up an index to a KB in a second language, such as Spanish or Japanese.","1994","2021-02-07 01:44:57","2021-02-07 01:44:57","","773-778","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :97</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce the system ATRACT, which is a semi-automatic knowledge acquisition tool designed to facilitate the construction of the desired translation rules through the use of inductive machine learning techniques. Rather than building rules by hand from scratch, a user of ATRACT can obtain good candidate rules by providing the system with a collection of examples of Japanese sentences along with their English translations. This learning task is characterized by two factors: (i) It involves exploiting a huge amount of semantic information as background knowledge. (ii) Training examples are 'ambiguous'. Currently, two learning methods are available in ATRACT. Experiments show that these methods lead to rules that are very close to those composed manually by human experts given only a reasonable number of examples. These results suggest that ATRACT will significantly contribute to reducing the cost and improving the quality of ALT-J/E translation rules.","1994","2021-02-07 01:45:00","2021-02-07 01:45:00","","194-201","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is intended to be extensible to realms outside of the temporal domain (e.g., the spatial domain). The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection process during generation: there is often a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect possibilities that may be produced from a lexical semantic representation, which, as defined in the model presented here, is largely underspecified. Temporal/aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-language terms limit the possibilities for generation of tense and aspect.

Then the components of a machine translation system are explained from the standpoint of software, linguistic components, and users' demands. The importance of pre-editing and post-editing is stressed. The semantic and contextual processings are essential to obtain a better translation quality, which are the future problems to attack. Attention is given to the difficulty of contemplating a pivot method in machine translation instead of transfer methods, because the projection from a word or a phrase to a concept is very difficult if we want to have a very exact concept representation and translation. A new transfer method which accompanies the pe-transfer structural adjustment and post-transfer adjustment is explained. This method was adopted by the Japanese governmental project of machine translation which was directed by the author. Various mechanisms of structural transformations in the transfer and generation processes are explained, which are necessitated by the language translation between the two languages of different language families like Japanese and English. Finally some comments are given from the standpoint of users of machine translation systems. Systems always are imperfect, and users must use them after recognizing the possibilities and the limitations of the system. © 1986.","1986","2021-02-07 01:45:17","2021-02-07 01:45:17","","77-82","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, ""virtual machine translation"" means a kind of syntax-oriented literal translation which may be regarded as an idealized competence of today's practical machine translation. The above comparison shows that the main reason for the limitation or the incompleteness of current practical machine translation systems is the insufficient ability to treat ""structural idiosyncrasies"" of sentences. Also, some translation examples tell us that, without ""understanding"" the total meaning of the source sentence, it is quite difficult to manipulate the idiosyncrasies in sentence structure. Idiosyncratic gaps between source and target sentence structure usually originate in cultural differences, so that the computational treatment of these gaps is a very difficult problem. But the translation examples also give us some encouraging evidence that the principal technologies of today's not-yet-completed machine translation have sufficient potential for producing barely acceptable translation. The current practical efforts to treat such structural idiosyncrasies are also mentioned together with some long-range, basic-research type of approaches. © 1986.","1986","2021-02-07 01:45:19","2021-02-07 01:45:19","","101-115","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 February 2021</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that competent translation requires some reasonable depth of understanding of the source text, and, in particular, access to detailed contextual information. The following machine translation paradigm is proposed. First, the source text is analyzed and mapped into a language-free conceptual representation. Inference mechanisms then apply contextual world knowledge to augment the representation in various ways, adding information about items that were only implicit in the input text. Finally, a natural-language generator maps appropriate sections of the language-free representation into the target language. We discuss several difficult translation problems from this viewpoint with examples of English-to-Spanish and English-to-Russian translations; and illustrate possible solutions as embodied in a computer understander called SAM, which reads certain kinds of newspaper stories, then summarizes or paraphrases them in a variety of languages.

Because of the rigid constraints imposed by automatic machines, the formulation of translation algorithms involves unprecedented problems of a linguistic nature. Much of the existing literature in the field of machine translation consists of theoretical treatments of these problems, or of appropriately simplified abstractions from these problems. Several specific algorithms for the machine translation of Russian to English have been proposed, but none have been tested on a large scale. These rules are apparently based on the intuition and linguistic backgrounds of the individual writers, sometimes aided by the manual analysis of short text samples. Until very recently the use of automatic machines has been confined to the application of ad-hoc computer programs, tailored to the processing of particular sentences or carefully selected texts. © 1958 Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.
