It alone handles out-of-vocabulary words, but tends to not consistently segment inflected words. Controlled byte pair encoding (CBPE) allowed our word-level neural machine translation (NMT) model to easily recognize inflected words which are prevalent in morphologically-rich languages. It prevented BPE from merging affixes in a word to other characters in the word. Our resulting NMT models from CBPE consistently evaluates affixes that could've been segmented with variations in BPE. In our experiments, we considered 119,969 English-Filipino parallel language pairs from an existing dataset, with Filipino as a morphologically-rich language. The results show that BPE and CBPE both showed improvements in the BLEU scores from 38.31 to 44.82 and 44.07 for English→Filipino, and from 32.17 to 35.25 and 35.98 for Filipino→English, respectively. The lower scores in the Filipino→English can be attributed to other language characteristics of Filipino such as free word order, one-to-many relationship in translating from English to Filipino, and some transliterations in the parallel corpus.

Our shift from a pointwise to a listwise perspective proves to be a simple yet powerful extension to current modeling that allows arbitrary pairwise functions to be incorporated as features, whose weights can be estimated jointly with traditional ones.

This study proposes a better approach, which does not require in-depth knowledge of the linguistic properties of the languages, but it produces a good quality translation. This statistical machine translation uses parallel corpus and statistical machine learning for English and Bahasa Indonesia.

The pruning process, user interface, and the personalization of translation have a very important role in implementing of this machine translation. The result is quite promising. It shows that pruning process increases of the translation process time.

As homoeopathy rests on a basic principle of nature, allopathic or other western methods do not pay any attention to the symptoms of the patient and the medicine is prescribed on the basis of the name of the ailment, whatever are the symptoms? An English-Hindi machine translation (MT) system for the translation of allopathic terminologies requires to translate only the ailment, therapeutic description, name of remedies and doctor's recommendation, but when it comes to translating the homoeopathic contents, necessitate to translate the general symptoms of the patient, ailments, name of medicines, and prescription. In fact the general medical MT system may not use symbols, doctor's prescriptions, symptoms of patient and medicines with potencies (such as Ipecac Q or 30, Ferrum met. 3X, Syphilinum 1M) the way they are used in Homoeopathy.

Hence the objective of this study is to propose a statistical approach for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration of Malay manuscript contents using Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) as its model. In order to achieve such purpose, quality score of Word Error Rate (WER) was computed on the transliteration output. Besides, the issues formerly encountered by rule based approach such as vocals limitation and homograph, reduplication, letters error and combination of multiple words were observed in the implementation. Moreover, this paper utilized exploratory approach as its research strategy and mixed method as its research method. The data for the analysis were extracted from a MM titled Bida̅yat al-Mubtadi̅ biFaḑlilla̅h al-Muhdi̅. Quality score of WER was computed for the evaluation of SMT output. Afterwards, related issues were identified and assessed. The research found that quality score of PBSMT for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration was high in terms of WER, however the issues of rule based were generally addressed by PBSMT except homograph. The research is however limited to the approach of SMT that solely focused on PBSMT as its model. Moreover, the corpus size was limited to one manuscript while SMT relies on corpus size. Nevertheless the research contributes to the wider coverage on Malay language as one of the under resource languages in NLP, in form of old and modern jawi.

One of the most undesired phenomena is lexical gap. A lexical gap occurs in case of lacking Vietnamese equivalent word to English word. There are some approaches to this obstacle. Some researchers prefer replacing lexical gap by its nearest meaning word. However, in out project there isn't a conception database for Vietnamese word that helps to find acceptable word to lexical gap. Our approach for lexical gap establishes a word - to - phrase model for EVMT. Naive replacements of word by phrase keep semantic information as much as possible, however, lead translated sentences to syntactic mismatch, and therefore ungrammatical text. We restructure target sentence using phrase in dictionary as template of formal phrase structure in the model with some algorithms to keep target sentence be grammatical.

Therefore, in this paper, using the generative method, the latent vector space based on the source language and the target language is constructed. The advantage is that the translation decoding is only subject to the independent distribution in the potential space, and is not affected by the historical target translation, so the translation delay of the target language is alleviated, and the error accumulation problem of the traditional method is also avoided.

There are several approaches to machine translation, some of them need extensive linguistic knowledge while others require enormous statistical calculations. This paper presents a hybrid method, integrating corpus based approach and statistical approach for translating Bengali sentences into English with the help of N-gram language model. The corpus based method finds the corresponding target language translation of sentence fragments, selecting the best match text from the bilingual corpus to acquire knowledge while the N-gram model rearranges the sentence constituents to get an accurate translation without employing external linguistic rules. A variety of Bengali sentences, including various structures and verb tenses are considered to translate through the new system. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of adequacy, fluency, WER, and BLEU score. The assessment scores are compared with other conventional approaches as well as with Google Translate, a well-known free machine translation service by Google.

It splits a source sentence into sequences of translatable segments. We propose a maximum-entropy segmentation model to capture desirable phrasal and hierarchical segmentations for statistical machine translation. We present an approach to automatically learning the beginning and ending boundaries of cohesive segments from word-aligned bilingual data without using any additional resources. The learned boundaries are then used to define cohesive segments in both phrasal and hierarchical segmentations. We integrate the segmentation model into phrasal statistical machine translation (SMT) and conduct experiments on the newswire and broadcast news domain to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed segmentation model on a large-scale training data. Our experimental results show that the maximum-entropy segmentation model significantly improves translation quality in terms of BLEU. We further validate that 1) the proposed segmentation model significantly outperforms syntactic constraints which are used in previous work to constrain segmentations; and 2) it is necessary to capture hierarchical segmentations besides phrasal segmentations.,1558-7924,,,10.1109/TASL.2011.2144971,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753927,Bracketing transduction grammar (BTG)-based phrasal machine translation;hierarchical segmentation;maximum entropy;phrasal segmentation;statistical machine translation (SMT),Training data;Decoding;Entropy;Training;Feature extraction;Syntactics,computational linguistics;language translation;maximum entropy methods;statistical analysis,maximum-entropy segmentation model;source sentence;translatable segments;desirable phrasal segmentations;hierarchical segmentations;cohesive segments;word-aligned bilingual data;learned boundary;phrasal statistical machine translation;SMT;large-scale training data;translation quality;syntactic constraints,,3,25,,21-Apr-11,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,IEEE

However, previous research has shown that NMT suffers from several limitations: source coverage guidance, translation of rare words, and the limited vocabulary, while statistical machine translation (SMT) has complementary properties that correspond well to these limitations. It is straightforward to improve the translation performance by combining the advantages of two kinds of models. This paper proposes a general framework for incorporating the SMT word knowledge into NMT to alleviate above word-level limitations. In our framework, the NMT decoder makes more accurate word prediction by referring to the SMT word recommendations in both training and testing phases. Specifically, the SMT model offers informative word recommendations based on the NMT decoding information. Then, we use the SMT word predictions as prior knowledge to adjust the NMT word generation probability, which unitizes a neural network based classifier to digest the discrete word knowledge. In this paper, we use two model variants to implement the framework, one with a gating mechanism and the other with a direct competition mechanism.

As a consequence words in an input sentence are translated phrase by phrase individually and these words are than sooner or later organized in a particular way to get the target sentence. The paper discusses numerous fashions for the word based Statistical Machine translation. The paper is written with reference to Kashmiri Language, as not much work has been done in this regard.",,978-1-7281-1261-9,,10.1109/ICCES45898.2019.9002594,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9002594,Machine Translation;Word based Statistical Machine Translation;Kashmiri;Kashur,Conferences;Maximum likelihood estimation;Probability distribution;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data models,knowledge based systems;language translation;maximum likelihood estimation;natural language processing;text analysis,knowledge-based system;word primarily based SMT;maximum likelihood estimation;natural language;human languages;word based statistical machine translation;Kashmiri language,,,9,,20-Feb-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,IEEE

Neural MT (NMT), an end-to-end learning approach to MT, represents the current state-of-the-art in MT research. The recent studies on interactive MT have indicated that NMT can significantly outperform PB-SMT. In this work, first we investigate the possibility of integrating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags into the state-of-the-art NMT model, Transformer. Then, we explore whether integration of supertags into Transformer could indeed reduce human efforts in translation in an interactive-predictive platform. From our investigation we found that our syntax-aware interactive NMT (INMT) framework significantly reduces simulated human efforts in the French-to-English and Hindi- to-English translation tasks, achieving a 2.65 point absolute corresponding to 5.65% relative improvement and a 6.55 point absolute corresponding to 19.1% relative improvement, respectively, in terms of word prediction accuracy (WPA) over the respective baselines.",2161-4407,978-1-7281-6926-2,,10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207491,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207491,machine translation;neural machine translation;interactive neural machine translation,Syntactics;Predictive models;Task analysis;Protocols;Games;Grammar;Context modeling,language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;statistical analysis,PB-SMT;state-of-the-art NMT model;human efforts;interactive-predictive platform;syntax-aware interactive NMT framework;syntax-informed interactive neural machine translation;interactive machine translation;human translators correct errors;automatic translations;MT systems;phrase-based statistical MT;mainstream approach;neural MT;end-to-end learning approach;MT research;interactive MT;French-to-English Hindi-to-English translation tasks,,,40,,28-Sep-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,IEEE

Several high-level synthesis (HLS) or domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been developed to reduce the gap between high-level languages and hardware descriptive languages. However, each language tends to target some specific applications or there is a big learning curve in learning DSLs, which ends up having many program languages and tool chains.To address these challenges, we propose the use of a source-to-source translation to pick and choose which framework to use so that the hardware designer chooses the best target HLS/DSL that can be synthesized to the best performing hardware. In this work, we present source-to-source translation between CUDA to OpenCL using NMT, which we call PLNMT. The contribution of our work is that it develops techniques to generate training inputs. To generate a training dataset, we extract CUDA API usages from CUDA examples and write corresponding OpenCL API usages. With a pair of API usages acquired, we construct API usage trees that helps users find unseen usages from new samples and easily add them to a training input.

Due to the lack of language resources, it is difficult to create MT from high-resource languages to low-resource languages like Indonesian ethnic languages. Nevertheless, Indonesian ethnic languages' characteristics motivate us to introduce a Pivot-Based Hybrid Machine Translation (PHMT) by combining SMT and RBMT with Indonesian as a pivot which we further utilize in a multilingual communication support system.

Although there exist many sources for bilingual corpora they do not appear in sentence aligned form. So developing an efficient method to align the sentences in such parallel corpora is an important step for NLP research. Researchers of NLP invested much effort to develop efficient methods for aligning sentences in such corpora and several methods have been developed which have been proved to be effective for different language pairs. As far as we are concerned till now no previous work has been done for aligning sentences in English-Bengali parallel corpora which is lagging us behind in NLP research.

To be specific, the generation inconsistency between the training and inference process further causes error accumulation and distribution disparity. Furthermore, NMT models are generally optimized on word-level cross-entropy loss function but evaluated by sentence-level metrics. This evaluation-level mismatch may mislead the promotion of translation performance. To address these two drawbacks, we propose to challenge training to gradually simulate inference. Namely, the decoder is fed with inferred words rather than ground truth words during training with a dynamic probability. To ensure accuracy and integrity, we adopt alignment and tailoring on the inferred words. Therefore, these words can leverage inferred information to help improve the training process. As for the dynamic simulation, we define a novel loss-sensitive probability that can sense the converge of training and finetune itself in turn. Experimental results on IWSLT 2016 German-English and WMT 2019 English-Chinese datasets demonstrate that our methodology can significantly improve translation quality.

Unknown word (UNK) symbols are used to represent out-of-vocabulary words because NMT typically operates with a fixed vocabulary size. These rare words can be effectively encoded as sequences of subword units by using algorithms, such as byte pair encoding (BPE), to tackle the UNK problem. However, for languages with highly inflected and morphological variations, such as Arabic, the aforementioned method has its own limitations that make it not effective enough for translation quality. To alleviate the UNK problem and address the inconvenient behavior of BPE when translating the Arabic language, we propose to utilize a romanization system that converts Arabic scripts to subword units. We investigate the effect of our approach on NMT performance under various segmentation scenarios and compare the results with systems trained on original Arabic form. In addition, we integrate Romanized Arabic as an input factor for Arabic-sourced NMT compared with well-known factors, namely, lemma, part-of-speech tags, and morph features. Extensive experiments on Arabic-Chinese translation demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively tackle the UNK problem and significantly improve the translation quality for Arabic-sourced translation.

It originated in the area currently known as the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic is the joint official language in Middle Eastern and African states. Large communities of Arabic speakers have existed outside of the Middle East since the end of the last century, particularly in the United States and Europe. So finding a quick and efficient Arabic machine translator has become an urgent necessity, due to the differences between the languages spoken in the world's communities and the vast development that has occurred worldwide. Arabic combines many of the significant challenges of other languages like word order and ambiguity. The word ordering problem because of Arabic has four sentence structures which allow different word orders. Ambiguity in the Arabic language is a notorious problem because of the richness and complexity of Arabic morphology. The core problems in machine translation are reordering the words and estimating the right word translation among many options in the lexicon. The Rule-Based Machine translation (RBMT) approach is the way to reorder words, and the statistical approach, such as Expectation Maximisation (EM), is the way to select right word translations and count word frequencies. Combining RBMT with EM plays an impotent role in generating a good-quality MT. This paper presents a combination of the rule-based machine translation (RBMT) approach with the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm. These two techniques have been applied successfully to word ordering and ambiguity problems in Arabic-to-English machine translation.",,978-1-7281-0108-8,10.1109/CAIS.2019.8769545,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769545,Hybrid Approach;Expectation Maximisation;Arabic machine translation problems,Syntactics;Morphology;Linguistics;Complexity theory;Grammar;Education;Tokenization,language translation;natural language processing;statistical analysis,Arabic language;Arabic morphology;word translation;rule-based machine translation approach;word frequencies;Arabic-to-English machine translation;Arabic speakers;word order;word ordering problem;hybrid rules;statistical method;major world languages;Arabic machine translator;rule-based machine translation;RBMT;expectation maximisation;right word translations,,,21,,Jul-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

To this end, previous works choose either to alter the architecture of NMT encoder to incorporate syntactic information into the translation model, or to generalize the embedding layer of the encoder to encode additional linguistic features. The former approach mainly focuses on injecting the syntactic structure of the source sentence into the encoding process, leading to a complicated model that lacks the flexibility to incorporate other types of knowledge. The latter extends word embeddings by considering additional linguistic knowledge as features to enrich the word representation. It thus does not explicitly balance the contribution from word embeddings and the contribution from additional linguistic knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a knowledge-aware NMT approach that models additional linguistic features in parallel to the word feature. The core idea is that we propose modeling a series of linguistic features at the word level (knowledge block) using a recurrent neural network (RNN). And in sentence level, those word-corresponding feature blocks are further encoded using a RNN encoder. In decoding, we propose a knowledge gate and an attention gate to dynamically control the proportions of information contributing to the generation of target words from different sources. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of better accounting for importance of additional linguistic, and we observe significant improvements from 1.0 to 2.3 BLEU points on Chinese$\leftrightarrow$ English and English$\rightarrow$German translation tasks.",2329-9304,,10.1109/TASLP.2018.2864648,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Opening Project of Beijing Key Laboratory of Internet Culture and Digital Dissemination Research; Joint Project of Macao Science and Technology Development Fund and National Natural Science Foundation of China; Multiyear Research Grant from the University of Macau; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8430540,Attention gate;knowledge block;knowledge gate;neural machine translation (NMT),Linguistics;Syntactics;Decoding;Speech processing;Recurrent neural networks;Encoding,encoding;language translation;linguistics;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets,linguistic knowledge-aware neural machine translation;NMT encoder;syntactic information;word embeddings;word representation;knowledge-aware NMT approach;recurrent neural network;RNN encoder;knowledge gate,,3,54,,Aug-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,IEEE

In this paper, we propose semantic features for phrase-based SMT (PB-SMT) using source-side semantic roles. The objective of proposed features is to employ predicate-argument information in an English-Persian SMT, which is a sample of low-resource language pairs. Then these features serve to re-rank list of n-best translations produced by the translation system. The first proposed feature tries to preserve the correlation between predicate-argument structures (PAS) among two languages, while the second one aims to preserve the internal cohesion of semantic roles. Both of these features use direct annotation projection to transfer semantic roles from the source to the target language. For extracting the last feature, the Persian Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is used which is trained on Persian semantic annotated data. We create the training data by automatically projecting the annotation from English to Persian using in-house parallel data, filtering out uncertain labels and also by bootstrapping. To our knowledge, this is the largest Persian corpus annotated with the semantic roles. Evaluations show that these features cause an improvement of 0.65 BLEU score over the baseline.

A model of the MT lexicon for verbs as an interface between syntactic parsing and semantic representations,Y. S. Alam,"Department of Digital Media, Hosei University, 3-7-2 Kajino-cho, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8584 Japan",2014 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA),Oct-14,2014,,,382,387,"Machine translation (MT) deals with a large amount of data which represents sentence meanings constructed on the basis of the grammatical rules and the lexical knowledge of the source and target languages. As it is hardly possible to make an automated semantic analysis of the source language data, predominant methods in use have been transfer models such as those of phrase-based statistical MT and pattern-based MT, the main task of which is to replace the source language text with the target language text without understanding them. As it is reported that nearly half the text data consist of unanalyzable multiword like collocations, idioms, and phrasal verbs, it would be inevitable to resort to such a method. At the same time, however, it has been observed that MT output quality suffers to a significant extent when the sentences are not divided into proper segments. This paper proposes a model of the lexicon of verbs whose rich relational information contributes to parsing and understanding sentences. While other existing models of lexicons have no or little consideration for their roles of interaction with processes of syntactic parsing and semantic representation, the proposed model is designed for playing a role as an interface between the two processes in handling sentences with regular usages of verbs as well as idiomatic and metaphoric usages.",,978-1-4799-4100-1,10.1109/ICInfA.2014.6932686,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932686,Machine translation;Lexicon for a parser;Lexicon of verbs;Metaphoric usages of verbs,Syntactics;Semantics;Compounds;Natural language processing;Context;Educational institutions;Abstracts,grammars;language translation;statistical analysis;text analysis,sentence meanings;grammatical rules;lexical knowledge;automated semantic analysis;source language data;transfer models;phrase-based statistical MT;pattern-based MT;source language text;target language text;text data;relational information;syntactic parsing;semantic representation;idiomatic usages;metaphoric usages;machine translation;MT lexicon model,,,16,,Oct-14,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

In the proposed approach, they are random variables with a prior and are integrated out during inference. We use Gibbs sampling to infer the word alignment posteriors. The inferred word alignments are compared against EM and variational Bayes (VB) inference in terms of their end-to-end translation performance on several language pairs and types of corpora up to 15 million sentence pairs. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms both EM and VB in the majority of test cases. Further analysis reveals that the proposed method effectively addresses the high-fertility rare word problem in EM and unaligned rare word problem in VB, achieves higher agreement and vocabulary coverage rates than both, and leads to smaller phrase tables.",1558-7924,,10.1109/TASL.2013.2244087,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425427,Bayesian methods;Gibbs sampling;statistical machine translation (SMT);word alignment,Hidden Markov models;Bayesian methods;Random variables;Inference algorithms;Speech;Speech processing;Computational modeling,belief networks;expectation-maximisation algorithm;inference mechanisms;language translation;natural language processing;probability;random processes;sampling methods;word processing,vocabulary coverage rates;phrase tables;variational Bayes inference;expectation-maximization algorithm;VB;unaligned rare word problem;EM;high-fertility rare word problem;sentence pairs;corpora types;language pairs;random variables;IBM models;Gibbs sampling;Bayesian word alignment posterior inference;statistical machine translation performance improvement,,3,57,,Feb-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,IEEE

Multi-source translation is an approach that attempts to resolve these ambiguities by exploiting multiple inputs (e.g. sentences in three different languages) to increase translation accuracy. These methods are trained on multilingual corpora, which include the multiple source languages and the target language, and then at test time uses information from both source languages while generating the target. While there are many of these multilingual corpora, such as multilingual translations of TED talks or European parliament proceedings, in practice, many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations in all of the relevant languages. Existing studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations, and thus are only applicable to complete corpora that have all of the languages of interest, severely limiting their practical applicability. In this article, we examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) that can learn from and translate such incomplete corpora. Specifically, we propose methods to deal with incomplete corpora at both training time and test time. For training time, we examine two methods: (1) a simple method that simply replaces missing source translations with a special NULL symbol, and (2) a data augmentation approach that fills in incomplete parts with source translations created from multi-source NMT. For test-time, we examine methods that use multi-source translation even when only a single source is provided by first translating into an additional auxiliary language using standard NMT, then using multi-source translation on the original source and this generated auxiliary language sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed training-time and test-time methods both significantly improve translation performance.",2329-9304,,10.1109/TASLP.2019.2959224,JSPS KAKENHI; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930957,Neural machine translation (NMT);multi-linguality;data augmentation,Training;Decoding;Standards;Speech processing;Europe;Probability;Training data,language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets,multilingual translations;multilingual corpora;multisource neural machine translation;incomplete corpora;training time;source translations;multisource NMT;test-time;translation performance;machine-learning methods;translation accuracy;multiple source languages;missing data;word ordering;word choice;missing source translations;NULL symbol,,,27,IEEE,Dec-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,IEEE

It is part of Indo-Aryan family which is a branch of Indo-European languages. Based on our literature review, we have found that there are 3 Gujarati translators available but none of them provides the accurate translation of Gujarati idioms. This is so because they follow a token-based dictionary-based approach. We have created a corpus of nearly 3000 n-gram idioms of Gujarati language and done an intensive analysis of the same. From this corpus, nearly 1800 bigram idioms have been targeted for Machine Translation using a phrase-based dictionary-based approach. Idiom is a sequence of tokens whose meaning is different from the combination of the literal meaning of the individual tokens forming the idiom. Unlike many natural language tokens, the meaning of idiom does not change with time and space. The proposed Gujarati to English Idioms Translator works well for the bigrams and being based on idioms is free from the effect of getting obsolete with time as well as free from giving unexpected output at a geographically different location throughout the world.",,978-1-5090-3669-1,10.1109/PDGC.2016.7913143,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7913143,Bigram;English;Gujarati;Idiom;Machine Translation System (MTS),Decision support systems;Google;Bibliographies;Natural languages;Hafnium compounds,language translation;natural language processing;text analysis,Gujarati language;Indo-Aryan family;Indo-European languages;Gujarati bigram idiom translation;token-based dictionary-based approach;machine translation;phrase-based dictionary-based approach;Gujarati to English Idioms Translator;GIdTra;dictionary-based MTS,,1,9,,Apr-17,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

To fill the gap of lacking test oracles for in-vivo testing of NMT systems, we propose a new methodology for automatically identifying translation failures without reference translations.

Firstly, two kinds of dependency structure-based rules are extracted based on the source-side dependency tree and corresponding word alignments between the source-side and the target-side sentences. Then a maximum entropy classifier is used to calculate the orientation probability in terms of swap or monotone between two rules. As a result, a reordering rule set is obtained. Two different ways are proposed to filter out the rule set. Afterwards, the dependency parsing trees of the training data, development set and the test set are traversed, and if the syntactic sub-tree structure matches the rules in the rule set, the word orders will be adjusted. Thus, a reordered source-side sentence is generated and then fed into an SMT system for translation.

Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Language Model for Machine Translation,T. Okita; A. Way,"Sch. of Comput., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland; Sch. of Comput., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland",2010 International Conference on Asian Language Processing,Jan-11,2010,,,245,248,"The hierarchical Pitman-Yor process-based smoothing method applied to language model was proposed by Gold water and by The, the performance of this smoothing method is shown comparable with the modified Kneser-Ney method in terms of perplexity. Although this method was presented four years ago, there has been no paper which reports that this language model indeed improves translation quality in the context of Machine Translation (MT). This is important for the MT community since an improvement in perplexity does not always lead to an improvement in BLEU score, for example, the success of word alignment measured by Alignment Error Rate (AER) does not often lead to an improvement in BLEU. This paper reports in the context of MT that an improvement in perplexity really leads to an improvement in BLEU score. It turned out that an application of the Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Language Model (HPYLM) requires a minor change in the conventional decoding process. Additionally to this, we propose a new Pitman-Yor process-based statistical smoothing method similar to the Good-Turing method although the performance of this is inferior to HPYLM.

Consequently, users of neural machine translation algorithms do not have a way to check which outputted sentences have been translated correctly without employing an evaluation method. Therefore, we aim to define the confidence values in neural machine translation models. We suppose that setting a threshold to limit the confidence value would allow correctly translated sentences to exceed the threshold; thus, only clearly translated sentences would be outputted. Hence, users of such a translation tool can obtain a particular level of confidence in the translation correctness. We propose some indices; sentence log-likelihood, minimum variance, and average variance. After that, we calculated the correlation between each index and bilingual evaluation score (BLEU) to investigate the appropriateness of the defined confidence indices. As a result, sentence log-likelihood and average variance calculated by probability have a weak correlation with the BLEU score.

For any kind of MT, the model needs to be trained on a parallel corpus. In this paper we clean StackOverflow, one of the most popular online discussion forums for programmers, to generate a parallel English-Code corpus from Android posts. We contrast three data cleaning approaches: standard NLP, title only, and software task extraction. We evaluate the quality of the each corpus for MT. To provide indicators of how useful each corpus will be for machine translation, we provide researchers with measurements of the corpus size, percentage of unique tokens, and per-word maximum likelihood alignment entropy. We have used these corpus cleaning approaches to translate between English and Code [22, 23], to compare existing SMT approaches from word mapping to neural networks [24], and to re-examine the ""natural software"" hypothesis [29]. After cleaning and aligning the data, we create a simple maximum likelihood MT model to show that English words in the corpus map to a small number of specific code elements.

This involves taking a limited-size training dataset, where sentences are split into syntactically motivated sentences, and learning how to best segment arbitrary sentences into their corresponding phrases. The extrapolation of phrases is needed in numerous applications involving the generation of texts in natural language. One such application is machine translation, namely the automatic translation of unconstrained text from a source language to a target language. The phrasing model to be learnt comprises a number of parameters which need to be optimized based on the training data. To that end, a machine learning approach has been developed, which is based on the concept of attractive and repulsive forces. Instead of previous efforts using manual tuning of the parameters, here PSO is used to achieve the optimization of the model parameters.

Machine translation appears to be a promising solution for that purpose. In this work we build an English-Bodo Neural Machine Translation by adopting a two layered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells that can capture the long term dependencies. As very few work has been done on English-Bodo NMT, we make our baseline model which produced a BLEU Score of 11.8 . We then gradually overcome the baseline model by introducing several attention mechanism. We achieved a BLEU Score of 16.71 using the approach presented in Bahdanu. Furthermore we got a better BLEU score of 17.9 when we introduced beam search with a beam width of 5.

Inspired by context-rich word-sense disambiguation techniques, machine translation (MT) researchers have successfully integrated various types of source language context into the PBSMT model to improve target phrase selection. Among the various types of lexical and syntactic features, lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of super tags that preserve long-range word-to-word dependencies in a sentence have proven to be effective. These rich contextual features are able to disambiguate a source phrase, on the basis of the local syntactic behaviour of that phrase. In addition to local contextual information, global contextual information such as the grammatical structure of a sentence, sentence length and n-gram word sequences could provide additional important information to enhance this phrase-sense disambiguation. In this work, we explore various sentence similarity features by measuring similarity between a source sentence to be translated with the source-side of the bilingual training sentences and integrate them directly into the PBSMT model. We performed experiments on an English-to-Chinese translation task by applying sentence-similarity features both individually, and collaboratively with super tag-based features.

In the past, research efforts had demonstrated a 30-50% error using top-1 reference for transliteration. This error leads to performance degradation for many applications. In this paper, a novel approach to verify a given proper name transliteration pair using a discrete variant Hidden Markov Model (HMM) alignment is proposed. The state emission probabilities are derived from SMT phrase tables. The proposed method yields an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.73% on a 300 matched and 1000 unmatched name pairs test set. By comparison, the commonly used SMT framework yields 6.5% EER under the best configuration. The widely used edit distance approach has an EER of 22%.

Our results evidence that adaptive MT leads to an overall reduction in post-editing effort (HTER) up to 10.6% (p <; 0.05).

Initially, the method performs lexical analysis to process input transliterated Kannada sentence to recognize and classify tokens using newly constructed source language lexicon KannadaWordNet. Then, newly designed recursive descent parser for the domain validates the transliterated Kannada sentence with the syntactic constructs/grammar rules. Further, the phrase mapper and output generation mechanisms are employed to obtain translated English sentence. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a data set containing transliterated Kannada sentences of text written in low resolution images of display boards of Karnataka government offices in India.

We ascribe this similarity to the invariant source representations that lack dynamics across decoding steps. In this article, we propose a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU)-gated attention model (GAtt) for NMT. By updating the source representations with the previous decoder state via a GRU, GAtt enables translation-sensitive source representations that then contribute to discriminative context vectors. We further propose a variant of GAtt by swapping the input order of the source representations and the previous decoder state to the GRU. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English, WMT14 English-German, and WMT17 English-German translation tasks show that the two GAtt models achieve significant improvements over the vanilla attention-based NMT.

It is computationally more demanding than well-studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Also, in contrast to CNNs, RNNs heavily mix compute and memory bound layers which requires careful tuning on a latency machine to optimally use fast on-die memories for best single processor performance. Additionally, due to massive compute demand, it is essential to distribute the entire workload among several processors and even compute nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which attempts to scale this application on an Intel CPU cluster. Our CPU-based GNMT optimization, the first of its kind, achieves this by the following steps: (i) we choose a monolithic long short-term memory (LSTM) cell implementation from LIBXSMM library (specifically tuned for CPUs) and integrate it into TensorFlow, (ii) we modify GNMT code to use fused time step LSTM op for the encoding stage, (iii) we combine Horovod and Intel MLSL scaling libraries for improved performance on multiple nodes, and (iv) we extend the bucketing logic for grouping similar length sentences together to multiple nodes for achieving load balance across multiple ranks. In summary, we demonstrate that due to these changes we are able to outperform Google's stock CPU-based GNMT implementation by ~2x on single node and potentially enable more than 25x speedup using 16 node CPU cluster.",2168-9253,978-1-7281-4734-5,10.1109/CLUSTER.2019.8891019,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891019,machine translation;recurrent neural networks;TensorFlow;LIBXSMM;Intel architecture,Training;Parallel processing;Computational modeling;Libraries;Layout;Mathematical model;Recurrent neural networks,convolutional neural nets;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation,training Google neural machine translation;Intel CPU cluster;recurrent neural network;language translation application;convolutional neural networks;CNN;memory bound layers;latency machine;on-die memories;single processor performance;massive compute demand;CPU-based GNMT optimization;short-term memory cell implementation;GNMT code;fused time step LSTM op;Intel MLSL;multiple nodes;CPU cluster;Google stock CPU;Google neural machine translation,,,31,,07-Nov-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE
Features of Accuracy Mismatch between Back-Translated Sentences and Target-Translated Sentences,M. Miyabe; T. Yoshino,"Center for Knowledge Structuring, Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Fac. of Syst. Eng., Wakayama Univ., Wakayama, Japan",2011 Second International Conference on Culture and Computing,15-Dec-11,2011,,,63,68,"In communication using a machine translation, inaccurate translation prevents effective communication between individuals and leads to misunderstandings. Back-translation is used to check the accuracy of a sentence translated to a native language. For back-translation to be used as a method for checking the accuracy of a translated sentence, it has to satisfy the following conditions: There must be a positive correlation between the accuracy of sentences translated to an intermediate language and that of back-translated sentences, and there can be no significant difference between them. From the results of our verification, we found that back-translation satisfies these conditions. However, we found that accuracy mismatch case 1, which means that a back-translated sentence is accurate but the translated sentence is inaccurate, occurred although the number of such accuracy mismatch cases was small. Accuracy mismatch case 1 can lead to serious problems in communication. In this paper, we discuss the causes of accuracy mismatch case 1. We find that there are six features of accuracy mismatch between a back-translated sentence and its target-translated sentence.",,978-1-4577-1593-8,10.1109/Culture-Computing.2011.20,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103211,multilingual communication;machine translation;back-translation,Accuracy;Correlation;Educational institutions;Computer aided software engineering;Helium;Google;Electronic mail,language translation;natural language processing,accuracy mismatch;back-translated sentences;target-translated sentences;machine translation;native language;intermediate language,,,13,,15-Dec-11,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

Since writing styles are changing due to impact of languages on each other, higher version of morphological analyzers are desired for various NLP systems such as Machine Translation, Knowledge Extraction, Information Retrieval, etc. Often word level morphological analyzers adhere to language grammars and knowledge set pertaining to GNP and dictionary. Some algorithms use phrasal dictionaries also. But, impact of languages on each other leads to changes in GNP, grammatical and phrasal usage of words. General morph algorithms cannot deal with impact of such usage of words or phrases. Therefore new generation of morph analyzers are desired to handle cross lingual impact.

The methodology, although general, is oriented towards Machine Translation. Proposed methodology is based on creation of knowledge base for morph analyzers using formulations of FST and RTN.

Previous efforts on deep neural machine translation mainly focus on the encoder and the decoder, while little on the attention mechanism. However, the attention mechanism is of vital importance to induce the translation correspondence between different languages where shallow neural networks are relatively insufficient, especially when the encoder and decoder are deep. In this paper, we propose a deep attention model (DeepAtt). Based on the low-level attention information, DeepAtt is capable of automatically determining what should be passed or suppressed from the corresponding encoder layer so as to make the distributed representation appropriate for high-level attention and translation. We conduct experiments on NIST Chinese-English, WMT English-German, and WMT English-French translation tasks, where, with five attention layers, DeepAtt yields very competitive performance against the state-of-the-art results. We empirically find that with an adequate increase of attention layers, DeepAtt tends to produce more accurate attention weights.

FDA increase the diversity of the selected training set by devaluing features (i.e., n-grams) that have already been included. FDA5 decides which instances to select based on three functions used for initializing and decaying feature values and scaling sentence scores controlled with five parameters. We present optimization techniques that allow FDA5 to adapt these functions to in-domain and out-of-domain translation tasks for different language pairs. In a transductive learning setting, selection of training instances relevant to the test set can improve the final translation quality. In machine translation experiments performed on the 2 million sentence English-German section of the Europarl corpus, we show that a subset of the training set selected by FDA5 can gain up to 3.22 BLEU points compared to a randomly selected subset of the same size, can gain up to 0.41 BLEU points compared to using all of the available training data using only 15% of it, and can reach within 0.5 BLEU points to the full training set result by using only 2.7% of the full training data.

For translation, it simplifies any form (i.e. simple, complex, compound, active and passive form) of English sentence into the simplest form of English sentence i.e. subject plus verb plus object. When compared with existing rule based EtoB MT schemes, VBMT doesn't employ exclusive or individual structural rules of various English sentences; it only detects the main verb from any form of English sentence and then transforms it into the simplest form of English sentence. Thus VBMT can translate from EtoB very simply, correctly and efficiently. Rule based EtoB MT is tough because it requires the matching of sentences with the stored rules. Moreover, many existing EtoB MT schemes which deploy rules are almost inefficient to translate complex or complicated sentences because it is difficult to match them with well-established rules of English grammar. VBMT is efficient because after identifying the main verb of any form of English sentence, it binds the remaining parts of speech (POS) as subject and object. VBMT has been successfully implemented for the MT of Assertive, Interrogative, Imperative, Exclamatory, Active-Passive, Simple, Complex, and Compound form of English sentences applicable in both desktop and mobile applications.",,978-1-4799-5180-2,10.1109/ICIEV.2014.6850684,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850684,Rule based Machine Translation;Natural Language Processing;English to Bangla;Human Language Technology,Tagging;Compounds;Informatics;Conferences;Natural languages;Knowledge based systems;Databases,language translation;natural language processing,English to Bangla machine translation;VBMT;verb based machine translation;EtoB MT schemes;natural language processing;human language technology,,7,18,,10-Jul-14,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dynamic hierarchical decoder for NMT to utilize all of the target words in the training and decoding process. In the proposed model, a target word is represented by two latent attribute vectors rather than a word vector. The model is trained to dynamically put together those words that share similar linguistic attributes. The prediction of a target word is, therefore, turned into the prediction of attribute vectors, where the $\mathrm{softmax}$ functions are performed at the attribute level.

As times goes on, It is widely recognized that transfer learning methods are effective for low-resource language problems. However, existing transfer learning methods are typically based on the parent-child architecture, which does not adequately take advantages of helpful languages. In this paper, inspired by human transitive inference and learning ability, we handle this issue by proposing a new hierarchical transfer learning architecture for low-resource languages. In the architecture, the NMT model is trained in the unrelated high-resource language pair, the similar intermediate language pair and the low-resource language pair in turn. Correspondingly, the parameters are transferred and fine-tuned layer by layer for initialization. In this way, our hierarchical transfer learning architecture simultaneously combines the data volume advantages of high-resource languages and the syntactic similarity advantages of cognate languages. Specially, we utilize Byte Pair Encoding(BPE) and character-level embedding for data pre-processing, which effectively solve the problem of out of vocabulary(OOV).

Evaluation of the Validity of Back-Translation as a Method of Assessing the Accuracy of Machine Translation,M. Miyabe; T. Yoshino,"Fac. of Syst. Eng., Wakayama Univ., Wakayama, Japan; Fac. of Syst. Eng., Wakayama Univ., Wakayama, Japan",2015 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture Computing),14-Mar-16,2015,,,145,150,"Inaccurate translation prevents effective communication between individuals and leads to misunderstandings. Back-translation is a process used to check the accuracy of a sentence by translating it to the checker's native language. We believe that there is a positive correlation between the accuracy of sentences translated to a target language and that of back-translated sentences. Some studies have discussed the validity of back-translation from the standpoint of the performance evaluation of machine translation systems and concluded that back-translation was unsuitable for checking translation accuracy. However, this result has been derived from the process of verification of whether there was a positive correlation between the accuracy of target-translated sentences and that of back-translated sentences. This mode of verification is not suitable to human verification of back-translation. In this paper, we verified the validity of back-translation from the standpoint of a human checker. We focused on differences that tend to occur between checkers, and determined whether there were differences between target- and back-translated sentences. Our study's contribution can be summarized as follows: (1) we examined the co-occurrence rate of each evaluated value in the same sentence and revealed possible differences in evaluated values between checkers, and (2) we defined an acceptable range of accuracy mismatch based on these differences. Moreover, we revealed how the rate of accuracy mismatch changes with the extension of the acceptable range, which can be different for different purposes.

These are hard problems, where hand-crafting solutions is rarely feasible due to their inherent complexity. Higher level program comprehension is not dissimilar in nature: while a compiler or program analysis tool can extract certain facts from (correctly written) code, it has no intrinsic 'understanding' of the data and for the majority of real-world problems, a human developer is needed - for example to find and fix a bug or to summarize the bahavior of a method. We perform a pilot study to determine the suitability of neural machine translation (NMT) for processing plain-text source code. We find that, on one hand, NMT is too fragile to accurately tokenize code, while on the other hand, it can precisely recognize different types of tokens and make accurate guesses regarding their relative position in the local syntax tree. Our results suggest that NMT may be exploited for annotating and enriching out-of-context code snippets to support automated tooling for code comprehension problems.

In this paper, partially inspired by the idea of segmenting a long sentence into short clauses, each of which can be easily translated by NMT, we propose a hierarchy-to-sequence attentional NMT model to handle these two challenges. Our encoder takes the segmented clause sequence as input and explores a hierarchical neural network structure to model words, clauses, and sentences at different levels, particularly with two layers of recurrent neural networks modeling semantic compositionality at the word and clause level. Correspondingly, the decoder sequentially translates segmented clauses and simultaneously applies two types of attention models to capture contexts of interclause and intraclause for translation prediction. In this way, we can not only improve parameter learning, but also well explore different scopes of contexts for translation.

One popular framework models the translation process end-to-end using attentional encoder-decoder architecture and treats each word in the vectors of intermediate representation. These embedding vectors are sensitive to the meaning of words and allow semantically similar words to be near each other in the vector spaces and share their statistical power. Unfortunately, the model often maps such similar words too closely, which complicates distinguishing them. Consequently, NMT systems often mistranslate words that seem natural in the context but do not reflect the content of the source sentence. Incorporating auxiliary information usually enhances the discriminability. In this research, we integrate acoustic information within NMT by multi-task learning. Here, our model learns how to embed and translate word sequences based on their acoustic and semantic differences by helping it choose the correct output word based on its meaning and pronunciation.

However, we observe that the performance of MMT based on transformer is highly unstable since transformer model is sensitive to the fluctuation of hyper-parameters especially the number of layers, the dimension of word embeddings and hidden states, the number of multi-heads. Moreover, different ways of introducing image information also have significant influence on the performance of MMT.

Important factors to consider in GEC are not only the grammatical correction of the sentence, but also the recognition of a correct sentence in which no changes are required. However, GEC approaches in which deep learning recently started being used consider only the former aspect, which leads to overcorrection, whereby changes are made to a correct sentence unnecessarily. Because this bias is also reflected in performance metrics, conventional performance metrics consider only part of the important factors in GEC. This study proposes a new metric to consider both important aspects in GEC and to provide a new viewpoint for the GEC task. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to deal with comprehensively considering the correction performance and overcorrection problem in GEC. The experimental results demonstrate that the model performance ranking was reversed when evaluating the performance with the proposed metric compared to the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark [21], which only considers the correction performance. This indicates that the high performance of the correction does not result in less problems with the overcorrection and that the overcorrection problem should also be considered when evaluating the model performance.

In this paper, we propose topic-based coherence models to produce coherence for document translation, in terms of the continuity of sentence topics in a text. We automatically extract a coherence chain for each source text to be translated. Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. We build two topic-based coherence models on the predicted target coherence chain: 1) a word level coherence model that helps the decoder select coherent word translations and 2) a phrase level coherence model that guides the decoder to select coherent phrase translations. We integrate the two models into a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation system. Experiments on large-scale training data show that our coherence models achieve substantial improvements over both the baseline and models that are built on either document topics or sentence topics obtained under the assumption of direct topic correspondence between the source and target side.

The embedded complexities and incompatibilities of natural languages have made MT a daunting task facing numerous challenges, especially when it is to be compared to a manual translation. With the emergence of deep-learning AI approaches, the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has pushed MT results closer to human expectations. One of the newest deep learning approaches is the sequence-to-sequence approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), complex convolutions, and transformers, and employing encoders/decoder pairs. In this study, an attention-based deep learning architecture is proposed for MT, with all layers focused exclusively on multi-head attention and based on a transformer that includes multi-layer encoders/decoders. The main contributions of the proposed model lie in the weighted combination of layers' primary input and output of the previous layers, feeding into the next layer. This mechanism results in a more accurate transformation compared to non-hybrid inputs. The model is evaluated using two datasets for German/English translation, the WMT'14 dataset for training, and the newstest'2012 dataset for testing.

However, human translation is considered as the perfect language translation so far. In view of this, we propose a novel approach to machine translation that is inspired by phrase-based and multi-agent approaches. The approach is stimulated by the fact that how humans translate a sentence with psycholinguistic parsing. The approach has been tested with a multi-agent system named EnSiMaS that translates an English sentence into Sinhala. The EnSiMaS has been implemented through the MaSMT framework. This paper presents how English phrases are translated to Sinhala through the multi-agent approach. Each English phrase in the input sentence is assigned as an agent. According to the availability of the Sinhala words, phrase agents are capable of generating multiple Sinhala phrases with support of the Sinhala morphological and semantic system. These agents consider the structure of the phrase, semantic features of the words, and thematic roles of the existing phrase to generate the Sinhala translation. Further, phrase agents are capable of classifying each generated Sinhala phrase according to its context and usage. Communicating with other related agents, phrase agents identify the most suitable Sinhala phrase form generated Sinhala phrases.

These messages describe the content and purposes of changes, hence are useful for program comprehension and software maintenance. However, due to the lack of time and direct motivation, commit messages sometimes are neglected by developers. To address this problem, Jiang et al. proposed an approach (we refer to it as NMT), which leverages a neural machine translation algorithm to automatically generate short commit messages from code. The reported performance of their approach is promising, however, they did not explore why their approach performs well. Thus, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of their experimental results. We find that (1) Most of the test diffs from which NMT can generate high-quality messages are similar to one or more training diffs at the token level. (2) About 16% of the commit messages in Jiang et al.'s dataset are noisy due to being automatically generated or due to them describing repetitive trivial changes. (3) The performance of NMT declines by a large amount after removing such noisy commit messages. In addition, NMT is complicated and time-consuming. Inspired by our first finding, we proposed a simpler and faster approach, named NNGen (Nearest Neighbor Generator), to generate concise commit messages using the nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experimental results show that NNGen is over 2,600 times faster than NMT, and outperforms NMT in terms of BLEU (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate machine translation systems) by 21%.

Also, the impact of new features in combination with state-of-the-art features introduced in the literature is systematically evaluated. Statistical methods have been used for feature extraction and therefore this approach is independent to language.

To counteract this, We therefore propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge Distillation framework for low-resource neural machine translation, where the model learns from manually designed regularization distribution as a virtual teacher model.

In Machine Translation (MT), one of most important research fields of AI, models based on Recurrent Neural Net- works (RNN) show state-of-the-art performance in recent years, and many researchers keep working on improving RNN-based models to achieve better accuracy in translation tasks. Most implementations of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models employ a padding strategy when processing a mini-batch to make all sentences in a mini-batch have the same length. This enables an efficient utilization of caches and GPU/SIMD parallelism but leads to a waste of computation time. In this paper, we implement and parallelize batch learning for a Sequence-to- Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, which is the most basic model of NMT, without using a padding strategy. More specifically, our approach forms vectors which represent the input words as well as the neural network's states at different time steps into matrices when it processes one sentence, and as a result, the approach makes a better use of cache and optimizes the process that adjusts weights and biases during the back-propagation phase.

Similar to many other NLP applications, large scale training data can potentially bring higher translation accuracy for SMT models. However, the traditional single-node SMT model training systems can hardly cope with the fast-growing amount of large scale training corpus in the big data era, which makes the urgent requirement of efficient large scale machine translation model training systems. In this paper, we propose Seal, an efficient, scalable, and end-to-end offline SMT model training toolkit based on Apache Spark which is a widely-used distributed data-parallel platform. Seal parallelizes the training process of the entire three key SMT models that are the word alignment model, the translation model, and the N -Gram language model, respectively. To further improve the performance of the model training in Seal, we also propose a number of system optimization methods. In word alignment model training, by optimizing the block size tuning, the overhead of IO operation and communication is greatly reduced. In translation model training, by well encoding the training corpus, the data size transferred over the network can be reduced significantly, thus improving the overall training efficiency. We also optimize the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm to solve the data skew issue on the join operation which is adopted both in the translation model training and the language model training. The experiment results show that Seal outperforms the well-known SMT training system Chaski with about 5× speedup for word alignment model training. For the syntactic translation model and language model training, Seal outperforms the existing cutting-edge tools with about 9~18× speedup and 8~9× speedup on average, respectively. On the whole, Seal outperforms the existing distributed system with 4~6× speedup and the single-node system with 9~60× speedup on average respectively.

Based on the annotated data, a conditional random fields (CRF) sequential tagger is used to label the prosodic tags for Chinese sentences, and three methods are presented to integrate these features: (1) factored translation models where the prosodic features are incorporated as factors; (2) a word lattice decoding model where the prosodic boundaries are considered to be an alternative to the tokenization boundaries; (3) re-ranking models where the prosodic features are integrated in the language model to re-score the n-best translation candidates.

Due to these differences, there is a need to translate these dialects between each other to facilitate their understanding and handling by people who will use them from other communities. The tremendous technological advancement and the flourishing of the era of Deep Learning, has led to the emergence of so-called neural machine translation (NMT), which has significantly facilitated the translation process compared to other methods. In this paper, we present a framework to translate the Jordanian dialect into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) using Deep Learning, in particular, the RNN encoder-decoder model, which provided good results on the level of our manually created dataset. The conducted experiments using this model were divided into two parts: word level and sentence level, and the results were as follows: loss equals 0.8 and accuracy equals 91.3% when using the model for word to word translation; and loss value equals 3.33 and accuracy equals 63.2% when using the model for sentence translation.

The challenges are quite clear when one compares the gradually emerging Arabic to English Machine Translation with the rapidly developing Machine Translations available today. The lagging of the former may be attributed to two reasons. The first is the impenetrability of some Arabic words, which puzzles their decomposition into morphemes. The second is the incompatibility of existing machine-translation techniques with the Arabic language. The degree of difficulty can easily be observed by checking the results of any artless round-trip machine translation of arbitrary Arabic texts. Even the most advanced technologies that are available today are challenged. Regardless of whether the round trip is Arabicto- English-to-Arabic or English-to-Arabic-to-English, the inevitable outcome will be disenchanting. This leads to an even more disappointing conclusion. That is, as long as no drastic improvements are made, one must not take output of any machine translation of Arabic as orthodox. Yet another disappointing fact is that most of the intelligent machines are built to produce woodenly literal or paraphrased translations.

This conversion considers the phonological structure of the target language, as the transliterated output needs to be pronounceable in the target language. For example, a word in Vietnamese that begins with a consonant cluster is phonologically invalid and thus would be an incorrect output of a transliteration system. Most statistical transliteration approaches, albeit being widely adopted, do not explicitly model the target language's phonology, which often results in invalid outputs. The problem is compounded by the limited linguistic resources available when converting foreign words to transliterated words in the target language. In this paper, we present a phonology-augmented statistical framework suitable for transliteration, especially when only limited linguistic resources are available. We propose the concept of pseudo-syllables as structures representing how segments of a foreign word are organized according to the syllables of the target language's phonology.

Previous bitext parsing methods use human-annotated bilingual treebanks that are costly and troublesome to obtain. In the proposed method, we use an auto-generated bilingual treebank to train the parsing models. First, an SMT system is used to translate a monolingual treebank into the target language; then, a monolingual parser for the target language is used to parse the translated sentences. Since the auto-translated sentences and auto-parsed trees in the auto-generated bilingual treebank are far from perfect, the bilingual constraints are not sufficiently reliable. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to verify the reliability of the constraints using a large amount of target monolingual and bilingual unannotated data. Finally, we design a set of effective bilingual features for parsing models on the basis of the verified constraints. We conduct the experiments using a standard test data. The experimental results show that our bitext parser significantly outperforms monolingual parsers. Moreover, our method is still able to provide improvement when we use a larger monolingual treebank containing over 50 000 sentences. We also test the proposed method with different SMT systems and the results show that our method is very robust to the noise. In particular, the proposed method can be used in a purely monolingual setting with the help of SMT.

Processing of natural language involves various levels, complexities, ambiguities arise at each of those levels. Some pragmatic and semantic approaches can be used to tackle these issues. Generally, prepositions are plays sound role in meaningful translation for any languages. While translating from English to Tamil, preposition in English sentences should be translated to postposition to have meaningful sentences. Thus the prepositional phase errors and orthographic errors are the major issue in machine translation. The main goal of this paper is to improve the translation quality. To achieve the goal, we use some semantic rule to correct the prepositional and orthographic errors in this English-Tamil translation.

However, in some domain-specific tasks, only the corpora from similar domains can improve translation performance. If out-of-domain corpora are directly added into the in-domain corpus, the translation performance may even degrade. Therefore, domain adaptation techniques are essential to solve the NMT domain problem. Most existing methods for domain adaptation are designed for the conventional phrase-based machine translation. For NMT domain adaptation, there have been only a few studies on topics such as fine tuning, domain tags, and domain features. In this paper, we have four goals for sentence level NMT domain adaptation. First, the NMT's internal sentence embedding is exploited and the sentence embedding similarity is used to select out-of-domain sentences that are close to the in-domain corpus. Second, we propose three sentence weighting methods, i.e., sentence weighting, domain weighting, and batch weighting, to balance the data distribution during NMT training. Third, in addition, we propose dynamic training methods to adjust the sentence selection and weighting during NMT training. Fourth, to solve the multidomain problem in a real-world NMT scenario where the domain distributions of training and testing data often mismatch, we proposed a multidomain sentence weighting method to balance the domain distributions of training data and match the domain distributions of training and testing data.

In this article, we propose a novel framework that is capable of improving the translation quality even if the constraints are noisy. The key to our framework is to treat the lexical constraints as external memories. More concretely, it encodes the constraints by a memory encoder and then leverages the memories by a memory integrator. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can not only deliver substantial BLEU gains in handling noisy constraints, but also achieve speedup in decoding. These results motivate us to apply our models to a new scenario where the constraints are generated without the help of users.

To meet the requirements of making a real-time response, some research has been performed to filter the translation table. However, most existing methods are always based on one or two constraints that act as hard rules, such as not allowing phrase-pairs with low translation probabilities. These approaches sometimes make constraints rigid because they consider only a single factor instead of composite factors. Based on the considerations above, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework that integrates multiple features for translation model pruning. Experimental results show that our framework is effective by pruning 80% of the phrase-pairs and 70% of the hierarchical rules, while retaining the quality of the translation models when using the BLEU evaluation metric.

In this research work, a never before applied approach for language translation to a Philippine language was used for a Cebuano to Tagalog translator. A Recurrent Neural Network was used to implement the translator using OpenNMT sequence modeling tool in TensorFlow. The performance of the translation was evaluated using the BLEU Score metric. For the Cebuano to Tagalog translation, BLEU produced a score of 20.01. A subword unit translation for verbs and copyable approach was performed where commonly seen mistranslated words from the source to the target were corrected. The BLEU score increased to 22.87.

When these applications are deployed on web with increasing translation load web user experience degrades. The end user has to wait unusually longer to get his first visible response. Generic layer 3 load balancing techniques does not help to improve the response time as each job is assigned similar compute resources irrespective of job size. This paper presents an engineering approach to deploy MT system on cloud platform using Storm, a distributed computing framework. This scheme, by utilizing the inherent parallelism of a functional application, not only reduces the job completion time considerably but it, also as a web application, gives very good user experience, viz., the first visible response time within an acceptable time limit, and the subsequent responses well before the user finishes perusing the preceding response. Using Storm framework a translation job is split into multiple job partitions and is streamed into the storm cluster such that first job partitions of all jobs are processed before the second partitions, i.e., All nth partitions of all jobs are processed before (n+1)th partitions. Thus machine translation system is able to produce translation output as a continuous stream, sentence by sentence, as soon as each sentence gets translated. The system maintains flow rate of translated sentences stream high enough so that the next translated sentence is produced well before the end user finishes reading the previous sentence, thereby providing very good user experience.

Firstly, the syntactic knowledge is acquired and added to paraphrase extraction algorithm as constraints to obtain higher quality paraphrases from a parallel corpora. Then the extracted paraphrases are used to update the phrase table and reordering table of the translation system based on the unknown words and phrases in the source-side sentences of the development set and test set. Specifically, if a paraphrase of an unknown word or phrase in a source-side sentence of the development set and test set exists in the phrase table or reordering table, then a new phrase pair constructed with this unknown word or phrase with the target-side word or phrase of this paraphrase will be added to the phrase table or reordering table. In doing so, it can reduce the number of our-of-vocabulary words, and improve the coverage of the test set by the paraphrase-enhanced tables. Finally, the translation results are obtained using the updated phrase table and reordering table by translating the source language sentences.

We claim that the features leading to highest accuracy in translator attribution are translator-dependent features and that even though translator-effect-heavy features are present in translated text, we can still succeed in authorship attribution. These findings demonstrate that stylometric features of the original text are preserved at some level despite multiple consequent translations and the introduction of translator-dependent features.

As natural language processing and machine techniques advance, more mature machine translation techniques are providing a cheap though imperfect alternative, and the Google Translation service has already been widely used for translating websites and apps.

In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware recurrent encoder (CAEncoder), as an alternative to the widely-used bidirectional encoder, such that the future and history contexts can be fully incorporated into the learned source representations. Our CAEncoder involves a two-level hierarchy: The bottom level summarizes the history information, whereas the upper level assembles the summarized history and future context into source representations. Additionally, CAEncoder is as efficient as the bidirectional RNN encoder in terms of both training and decoding.

Syntax-Directed Machine Translation of Natural Language: Effect of Garden Path Phenomenon on Sentence Structure,J. Du; P. Yu,"NA; Sch. of Liberal Arts, Ludong Univ., Yantai, China",2010 International Conference on Intelligent System Design and Engineering Application,11-Apr-11,2010,2,,535,539,"The potential of current machine translation (MT) of natural languages is discussed by comparing the output of embedded structure sentence, ambiguous sentence and garden path sentence. The syntax-oriented MT is a kind of literal translation which may be regarded as an idealized competence of today's practical MT. The above comparison shows that the main reason for the incompleteness of current practical MT systems is the insufficient ability to treat structural ambiguousness of sentences. With the help of Recursive Transition Network (RTN), N-S Flowchart techniques for structured programming and Context-Free Grammar (CFG), the translation examples present that, without understanding the total meaning of the source sentence, it is quite difficult to manipulate the garden path phenomenon in sentence structure. Garden path effect on sentence structure usually originates from syntactic differences, so that the syntax-free computational translation of these sentences is a very difficult problem. However, encouraging evidence is provided that the principal technologies of today's hybrid-knowledge-based MT have sufficient potential for producing barely acceptable translation. Garden path sentence possesses the features of processing breakdown and backtracking, which bring lingering effect on automatic processing. Only on the basis of hybrid knowledge databases of MT system can the suffering from garden path effect on sentence structure be alleviated and can robustness of MT system be enhanced.",,978-1-4244-8333-4,10.1109/ISDEA.2010.204,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5743475,machine translation;recursive transition network;N-S flowchart;context-free grammar;garden path phenomenon,Grammar;Programming;Flowcharts;Decoding;Natural languages;Syntactics;Artificial intelligence,computational linguistics;context-free grammars;embedded systems;graph theory;language translation,syntax directed machine translation;natural language translation;embedded structure sentence;garden path sentence;recursive transition network;N-S flowchart technique;context free grammar;syntax free computational translation;hybrid knowledge based MT;knowledge database,,1,26,,11-Apr-11,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

Unlike previous work, we model the two problems in a single training paradigm simultaneously. We design a loss-augmented approach that explicitly considers the limited beam-width and evaluation metric in training, and present a simple but effective method to learn the model.

For existing MT systems, especially Statistic based MT(SBMT), the issue of multiword expressions (MWEs) detection and accurate correspondence from source to target language remains an unsolved problem. Template or Super Function based machine translation system suffer less from the existance of MWEs, but MWEs are still main holdback of MT systems. Our initial experiments on the Chinese-Japanese MT systems reveal that, where MWEs exist, SFBMT system suffer in terms of both efficiency ,comprehensibility and adequacy of finding the translation functions. Statistic based Machine Translation suffers more than SFBMT. For SFBMT systems to become of further practical use, they need to be enhanced with MWEs processing capability. As part of our study towards this goal, we proposed a discriminative latent model, which was developed for sequence labeling task, for identifying and extracting Chinese MWEs. In our evaluation, the tool achieved precisions ranging from 71.46% to 95.87% for different types of MWEs.

Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of “newest”. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system.

To alleviate the labor burden in replying to the bulk of user reviews, developers usually adopt a template-based strategy where the templates can express appreciation for using the app or mention the company email address for users to follow up. However, reading a large number of user reviews every day is not an easy task for developers. Thus, there is a need for more automation to help developers respond to user reviews. Addressing the aforementioned need, in this work we propose a novel approach RRGen that automatically generates review responses by learning knowledge relations between reviews and their responses. RRGen explicitly incorporates review attributes, such as user rating and review length, and learns the relations between reviews and corresponding responses in a supervised way from the available training data. Experiments on 58 apps and 309,246 review-response pairs highlight that RRGen outperforms the baselines by at least 67.4% in terms of BLEU-4 (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate dialogue response generation systems).

Developers have been relying on in-house system testing for quality assurance of NMT. This testing methodology requires human-constructed reference translations as the ground truth (test oracle) for example natural language inputs. The testing methodology has shown benefits of quickly enhancing an NMT system in early development stages. However, in industrial settings, it is desirable to detect translation failures without reliance on reference translations for enabling further improvements on translation quality in both industrial development and production environments. Aiming for a practical and scalable solution to such demand in the industrial settings, in this paper, we propose a new approach for automatically identifying translation failures without requiring reference translations for a translation task. Our approach focuses on a property of natural language translation that can be checked systematically by using information from both the test inputs (i.e., the texts to be translated) and the test outputs (i.e., the translations under inspection) of the NMT system. Our evaluation conducted on real-world datasets shows that our approach can effectively detect property violations as translation failures.

Since the conversion relates to the phonetic aspect of a text, syllabification is considered a major factor affecting the performance of a transliteration system. In grapheme-based approaches, there are two routines to transliterate, one is to perform in a pipeline of separate syllabification and other components in generation process step by step, the other is to synchronously segment syllables and generating transliteration options. Usually, joint decoding outperforms the cascade processing in many natural language processing missions, however, syllabification is a special component in transliteration task. Thus in this paper, we investigate the two routines with a systematic analysis and compare their results to illustrate the strength of syllabification.

Further, when such a system is needed to be deployed on a cloud infrastructure, mainly to facilitate auto-scaling of computational resources for varying load conditions, the task of deployment gets even more complicated and more time consuming.

Specifically, local features are extracted from action video frames and form bags of words based on k-means clustering. Though the appearance of an action may vary due to view changes, the underlying transfer tendency between visual words across views can be exploited. We propose two methods to measure the visual-word-based transfer relationship that are eventually based on frequency counts of word pairs. In the first method, word transfer probabilities are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of a shared action set with the EM algorithm. In the second method, word transfer probabilities are estimated by using likelihood-ratio tests. The two methods achieve comparable results and perform better when they are combined. For cross-view action classification, we compute action transfer probabilities based on the estimated word transfer probabilities and then implement a K-NN-like classification based on action video transfer probabilities.

Computer processing of Bangla language is a challenging task due to its varieties of words formation and way of speaking. The same meaning can be expressed in different ways which is a great challenge to face for translation by an automatic machine translation system. With the advent of internet technology and e-commerce, the demand of automatic machine translation has been increased. Parsing is essential for any type of natural language processing. Parsing of Bangla natural language can be used as a subsystem for Bangla to another language machine aided translation. A parser usually checks the validity of a sentence using grammatical rule. In this paper, we propose a set of transformational generative grammar (TGG) in conjunction with phrase structure grammar to generate parse tree and to recognize assertive, interrogative, imperative, optative and exclamatory sentences of Bangla language. It is applicable for many sentences that cannot be parsed using only phrase structure grammars. The process involves analysis of Bangla sentence morphologically, syntactically where tokens and grammatical information are passed through parsing stage and finally output can be achieved. A dictionary of lexicon is used which contains some syntactic, semantic, and possibly some pragmatic information.

However, the translation rules such as the non-lexical rule “ VP→(x0x1,VP:x1PP:x0)” in string-to-tree models do not consider any lexicalized information on the source or target side. The rule is so generalized that any subtree rooted at VP can substitute for the nonterminal VP:x1. Because rules containing nonterminals are frequently used when generating the target-side tree structures, there is a risk that rules of this type will potentially be severely misused in decoding due to a lack of lexicalization guidance. In this article, inspired by lexicalized PCFG, which is widely used in monolingual parsing, we propose to upgrade the STSG (synchronous tree substitution grammars)-based syntax translation model with bilingually lexicalized STSG. Using the string-to-tree translation model as a case study, we present generative and discriminative models to integrate lexicalized STSG into the translation model.

The incorporation of pseudo data in the training of GEC models is one of the main approaches for mitigating the problem of data scarcity.

Since large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora are usually costly to collect, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Inspired by the law of total probability, which connects the probability of a given target-side monolingual sentence to the conditional probability of translating from a source sentence to the target one, we propose to explicitly exploit this connection and help the training procedure of NMT models using monolingual data. The key technical challenge of this approach is that there are exponentially many source sentences for a target monolingual sentence while computing the sum of the conditional probability given each possible source sentence. We address this challenge by leveraging the reverse translation model (target-to-source translation model) to sample several mostly likely source-side sentences and avoid enumerating all possible candidate source sentences.

The problem becomes definitely serious due to the different grammatical pattern between source and target language. The previous research about reordering model in SMT use the distortion-based reordering approach. However, this approach is not suitable for Indonesian-Korean translation. The main reason is because the word order between Indonesian and Korean are mostly reversed. Therefore, in this study, we develop a source-side reordering rules by using POS tag and word alignment information. This technique is promising to solve the reordering problem based on the experimental result. By applying 130 reordering rules in ID-KR and 50 reordering rules for KR-ID translation, the quality of translation in term of BLEU score increases 1.25% for ID-KR translation and 0.83% for KR-ID translation.

However, the existing discriminator in GAN for NMT only combines two words as one query to train the translation models, which restrict the discriminator to be more meaningful and fail to apply rich monolingual information. Recent studies only consider one single reference translation during model training, this limit the GAN model to learn sufficient information about the representation of source sentence. These situations are even worse when languages are morphologically rich. In this article, an extended version of GAN model for neural machine translation is proposed to optimize the performance of morphologically rich language translation. In particular, we use the morphological word embedding instead of word embedding as input in GAN model to enrich the representation of words and overcome the data sparsity problem during model training.

To achieve this, we propose alignment-supervised bidimensional attention-based recursive autoencoders (ABattRAE) in this paper. ABattRAE first individually employs two recursive autoencoders to recover hierarchical tree structures of bilingual phrase, and treats the subphrase covered by each node on the tree as a linguistic item. Unlike previous methods, ABattRAE introduces a bidimensional attention network to measure the semantic matching degree between linguistic items of different languages, which enables our model to integrate information from all nodes by dynamically assigning varying weights to their corresponding embeddings. To ensure the accuracy of the generated attention weights in the attention network, ABattRAE incorporates word alignments as supervision signals to guide the learning procedure. Using the general stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we train our model in an end-to-end fashion, where the semantic similarity of translation equivalents is maximized while the semantic similarity of nontranslation pairs is minimized. Finally, we incorporate a semantic feature based on the learned bilingual phrase representations into a machine translation system for better translation selection. Experimental results on NIST Chinese-English and WMT English-German test sets show that our model achieves substantial improvements of up to 2.86 and 1.09 BLEU points over the baseline, respectively.

Even though findings presented here is for Sinhala to Tamil translation, the concept of pre-processing is language neutral and can be transcended to any other language pair with different parameters. To overcome the translation challenges in traditional SMT, preprocessing techniques are used. Preprocessing described in the research is related to generating phrasal units, Parts of Speech (POS) integration and segmentation. At the end, automatic evaluation of the system is performed by using BLEU as evaluation metrics. We observed all preprocessing techniques outperform the baseline system. The best performance is reported with PMI based chunking for Sinh ala to Tamil translation.

Also identifying the name entities and cognates present in the sentence pairs has proved to be advantageous while setting up the alignments.

This paper presents a minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) phrase table pruning method for pivot-based statistical machine translation (SMT). The SMT system requires a great amount of bilingual data to build a high-performance translation model. For some language pairs, such as Chinese-English, massive bilingual data are available on the web. However, for most language pairs, large-scale bilingual data are hard to obtain. Pivot-based SMT is proposed to solve the data scarcity problem: it introduces a pivot language to bridge the source language and the target language. Therefore, a source-target translation model based on well-trained source-pivot and pivot-target translation models can be derived with the pivot-based approach. However, due to the ambiguities of the pivot language, source and target phrases with different meanings may be wrongly matched. Consequently, the derived source-target phrase table may contain incorrect phrase pairs. To alleviate this problem, we apply the MBR method to prune the phrase table. The MBR pruning method removes the phrase pairs with the lowest risk from the phrase table. Experimental results on Europarl data show that the proposed method can both reduce the size of phrase tables and improve the performance of translations.

However, usage of attention is insufficient, some defects such as rare word problem still remain in end-to-end NMT approach, which is limited by the training targets and priori knowledge. Traditionally, words out of vocabulary (OOV words) are simply represented with a signal `UNK' or cut into sub-words. In this paper, we consider some optimizations on the alignment feature of attention mechanism, which is appropriate not only to guide every output to find the best match in input sentence, but also to help overall quality of the translation.

But this technology is still not able to deliver high quality translation and therefore post-editing is needed. Since post-editing could be time consuming even more than the translation process, having a quality estimation of the translated parts can be very useful. It means we need to estimate the confidence of the output without having any references. Moreover, Confidence Estimation (CE) can be useful for some applications that their goal is to improve machine translation quality such as system combination, regenerating and pruning. But there is not yet any completely satisfactory method for CE task. We propose context vector-based features that are never used for CE task. We classify MT output at word level.

First, we compare a variety of sentence representation strategies and propose a “Gated Sum” sentence representation to achieve better sentence semantic information. Then, rather than a single-layer sentence-level agreement architecture, we further propose a multi-layer sentence agreement architecture to make the source and target semantic spaces closer layer by layer. The proposed agreement module can be integrated into NMT as an additional training objective function, and can also be used to enhance the representation of the source-side sentences.

Combining Modern Machine Translation Software with LSI for Cross-Lingual Information Processing,R. Bradford; J. Pozniak,"Agilex Technol.

For applications requiring retrieval, clustering, and categorization of multilingual document collections, cross-lingual application of latent semantic indexing (LSI) has a number of characteristics that make it potentially attractive. However, this technique is dependent upon the availability of applicable parallel corpora. Historically, such corpora have been quite limited in size and scope. In this paper, we provide new results regarding implementation of cross-lingual LSI text processing systems employing parallel corpora produced using modern machine translation (MT) products. We present measurements using the Reuters 21578 test set to demonstrate three key points regarding this combined LSI/modern MT approach: (1) for some languages, this approach can create parallel corpora of sufficient fidelity to support effective multilingual and cross-lingual LSI applications, (2) the technique is not particularly sensitive to details of LSI parameters, and (3) multiple languages can be represented in a single LSI space with little degradation in performance.",,978-1-4799-3188-0,10.1109/ITNG.2014.52,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822177,cross-lingual;latent semantic indexing;machine translation;multilingual;parallel corpora,Large scale integration;Vectors;Training;Matrix decomposition;Standards;Abstracts;Semantics,indexing;information systems;language translation;text analysis,machine translation software;cross-lingual information processing;social interactions;business internationalization;multilingual information systems;multilingual document collection retrieval;multilingual document collection categorization;multilingual document collection clustering;latent semantic indexing;parallel corpora;cross-lingual LSI text processing systems;MT products;Reuters 21578 test;cross-lingual LSI applications,,2,72,,02-Jun-14,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

In this paper, we report on a study investigating the effects of introducing a machine translation mediated BBS that enables monolinguals to collaboratively translate Wikipedia articles using their mother tongues. From our experiment using this system, we found out that users made high use of the system and communicated actively across different languages. Furthermore, most of such multilingual discussions seemed to be successful in transferring knowledge between different languages. Such success appeared to be made possible by a distinctive communication pattern which emerged as the users tried to avoid misunderstandings from machine translation errors.

To detect these optional constituents, we consult the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) derivation tree of the source sentence. Adjoined words in these trees are good candidates for deletion. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted our experiments on English-Persian translation task.

The importance of translation cannot be underestimated, especially with the number of translation devices in use by travellers. Google Translate has set up a multilingual translation system and it is regularly used by people all over the world. In Mauritius, translation of the Mauritian Creole language is not available from Google Translate as the available size of the parallel corpora is quite small. The objective of this study is, therefore, to develop a web-based system for the translation between English language and the Mauritian Creole language for learning the two languages. This project on machine translation for the Mauritian Creole language is a starting point that will benefit the Mauritian population at large as well as the Tourism and Business sectors.

Mining their containing many-to-many relationship between symptoms and herbs are important for both clinical practice and novel prescriptions development. Previously, the research attention in this field is attracted by topic models and multi-label classification approaches, but they don't fully capture the correlations of labels and achieve very promising performance. Alternatively, we problematic it as a machine translation problem, that the source sentence is formed by symptoms and the target sentence consists of herbs. Two sentences are both in weakly order. In terms of this assumption, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture, namely TCM translator, to translate symptoms to herbs. Seq2seq, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is a well known framework for resolving the machine translation problem in natural language processing (NLP) community. It maps a bag of symptoms to the latent space, which is decoded to the target sentence, i.e., herbs. In this paper, transformer is used as our encoder to explore the latent correlations of symptoms and LSTM is implemented as the decoder to generate the herbs sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms other baseline models by a substantial margin.",,978-1-7281-1867-3,10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983384,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983384,traditional Chinese medicine;herbal prescription;deep learning;machine translation;sequence-to-sequence,,data mining;language translation;medical computing;medicine;natural language processing;patient treatment;pattern classification,herbal medicines;traditional Chinese medicine;herbal prescriptions;clinical practice;machine translation problem;sequence-to-sequence architecture;seq2seq;TCM translator;natural language processing community;sequence generation approach;prescription development,,1,46,,06-Feb-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,IEEE

Named as monotonic filter, this filter reduces the extracted rules from phrase pairs decomposable to monotonic aligned subphrases. We apply the monotonic filter on the hierarchical phrase-based, SAMT and phrase-boundary models. Our experiments are performed in translations from Persian, German and French to English as the source and target languages with low, medium and high monotonic word order respectively.

Typically, UBWE focuses on initializing the word embedding layer in the encoder and decoder of UNMT, whereas the CMLM focuses on initializing the entire encoder and decoder of UNMT. However, UBWE/CMLM training and UNMT training are independent, which makes it difficult to assess how the quality of UBWE/CMLM affects the performance of UNMT during UNMT training. In this paper, we first empirically explore relationships between UNMT and UBWE/CMLM. The empirical results demonstrate that the performance of UBWE and CMLM has a significant influence on the performance of UNMT. Motivated by this, we propose a novel UNMT structure with cross-lingual language representation agreement to capture the interaction between UBWE/CMLM and UNMT during UNMT training.
